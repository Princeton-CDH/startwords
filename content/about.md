*Startwords* is a research periodical irregularly published by the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. More formal than a blog yet more speculative and iterative than a peer-reviewed journal, *Startwords* is a forum for experimental humanities scholarship. Embedded code, data physicalizations, design, and emerging forms of process documentation are detailed through writing that is essayistic, creative, and research-driven.

Each issue features two articles that speak to a common theme, feature, or concern. “Snippets” invite readers to engage with the digital evidence underlying those articles. Issues will be released one to three times a year, when we have something to share or say.

*Startwords* (ISSN 2694-2658) is built with the Hugo static site generator using a custom-made theme. In support of open access principles, we publish all articles under a Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0) and the [website code](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords) under an Apache 2.0 license.
