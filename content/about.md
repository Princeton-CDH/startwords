*Startwords* is a research periodical irregularly published by the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. More formal than a blog yet more speculative and process-based than a peer-reviewed journal, *Startwords* is a forum for experimental humanities scholarship. Embedded code, data physicalizations, and emerging forms of project documentation are explored through writing that is creative, conversational, personal, essayistic, exploratory, data-driven, and academically rigorous.

Each issue will feature two articles that are unified by a common theme, feature, or concern. Issues will be released one to three times a year, when we have something to say or share. Articles can be contributed by CDH staff, faculty, graduate students, or external collaborators. Each article will be published in the following formats:

- PDF (formatted as a finished piece of scholarship)
- HTML (affords accessibility, interactivity, embedded data)
- .txt / markdown (affords sustainability and re-use)

*Startwords* articles can begin as CDH project essays (by the teams of *Shakespeare & Co. Project, Princeton Prosody Archive,* etc.) or as the product of individual research inquiries. Articles can range from 1,500 words to 8,000 words and wide latitude will be given to experiment with genre and style.

First issue to be released January 2020.
