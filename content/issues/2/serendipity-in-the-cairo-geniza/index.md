**Matthew:** In this piece Steffy and I continue the conversation from our April 2021 panel in order to explain the basis of our collaboration, the processes by which we analyze geniza texts and, most importantly, the stakes of crowdsourcing projects for historical research. Steffy's work in compiling collections of geniza fragments with similar formatting, scribal hands, and ink stamps alerted me to the existence of document types which could have otherwise taken months or years to locate. Her individual contributions speak volumes for the ways in which a vast network of ScribesSCG contributors has accelerated the accessibility of geniza texts. They are tackling foundational questions in the field of Cairo Geniza Studies that have never been pursued on such a mass scale. From the moment I happened upon the ScribesSCG discussion boards in the summer of 2020, I was struck by the abundance of user collections and comments regarding the distinctions between genres of literary and documentary fragments.[^1] Steffy, in your volunteer work and collections what are the core features within the layout of texts that you focus on in order to distinguish between fragment types?

**Steffy:** Since I can’t read Arabic or Hebrew, I take skilled hand-writing in straight lines with justified margins as signs of the work of professional scribes. Many, but not all, literary texts are neatly written by professional scribes using “square” Hebrew letters, with strictly justified margins. Liturgical poetry, for example, whether written by a scribe or not, might have an unjustified left margin, with a pattern of longer and shorter lines, like poetry in English, but read from right to left. Careful layout, good margins, and straight lines of beautiful script indicate to me that a fragment is “literary”, but other literary fragments (sermons, for example) may lack these features. I’m often unsure what type of fragment I’m looking at, so I like to read the notes on a fragment from the libraries which hold them, and any comments at the Scribes of the Cairo Geniza site. This slows my volunteer work, but greatly enriches my experience of the work.

The documentary texts are widely varied. Many legal documents, for example, look like the work of professional scribes., Lwhile letters from one merchant to another, some with margins crammed full of text written at an angle to the main text, look urgent rather than orderly. Still others are scrawled on re-used scraps of paper in handwriting that is far from well-trained. That was true of the “communal register” which you mentioned during our panel last April. In those fragments, a less-skilled writer keptwas keeping dated weekly records thatwhich always included some simple math sums. What might these fragments be?

**Matthew:** Just as you have noted, Steffy, besides the layout of texts and the economical usage of paper, some other features for assessing the genre of geniza fragments lie in script usage and the distribution of numerical figures. Square Hebrew letters, or " מרובע / merūbaʿ", are indeed a helpful indicator for tracing sacred literary texts. In the period I work on, between the sixteenth and -nineteenth centuries, many geniza texts begin to bear the influence of Sephardi rashi and solitreo scripts. As a result of the immigration of Sephardi refugees into Egypt across the fourteenth through -sixteenth centuries—– but especially after the Spanish expulsion of the 1492CE— –geniza fragments portray the increased influence of Iberian systems of Hebrew script.[^2]

Studying solitreo letter forms—– which were more commonly used in writing Judeo-Spanish— –can also be helpful for understanding how a variety of documents from the sixteenth-nineteenth centuries incorporate cursive writing. So, for example, in the Judeo-Arabic communal register I referenced during our panel, on occasion, there are interconnected letters in repeating words such as "berakha / blessing / ברכה" (in purple), "fiḍḍa / silver / פצה" (in green), and "seder / order / סדר" (in red).[^3] These cursive forms give the initial impression of messiness and lack of scribal skill yet it's crucial to recognize the pragmatic significance of this writing method. Connecting letters and abbreviating Judeo-Arabic words such as "ת׳׳ע / t[asāwī] ʿa[la]"[^4] (in blue) increased the speed at which a scribe could record notes when calligraphic aesthetics were not the objective.

The headings of this fragment from Steffy's collection were recorded during the weeks of October 7-20 1798CE– just before the Revolt of Cairo unfolded on the 21st-22nd when the city's residents fought to eject the French occupation under the leadership of Napoléon Bonaparte. The Jewish calendar dating appears in the heading of each list and it follows a shared formula throughout this type of communal register:

The surnames mentioned in each list– such as Vialobos, Ḥadād, and Skenderī –embody the lives of individuals and families who experienced one of the most turbulent periods in Egyptian political history. Between 1798-1801CE, the Egyptian populace withstood immense hardship in their efforts to defeat the French occupation and then between 1801-1805 as Ottoman military factions fought to assert their control over the province (a process which resulted in Muḥammad ʿAlī's rise to power as Pasha/Governor). What makes these register entries so significant, then, is that they offer a continuous internal perspective on how Cairene Jews supported their communal institutions during a period of harrowing instability.[^6] In my dissertation, I am working to compile the donation data from the many page fragments of these registers. This line of investigation may have never emerged in my research had it not been for my chance encounter with Steffy's collection in the ScribesSCG database.

[^1]: Jessica L. Goldberg and Eve Krakowski offer a helpful overview of the distinctions between literary and documentary fragments: "forms of geniza practice varied not only among communities but also over time, with some periods during which the Ben Ezra Geniza was in use seeing significant deposits of nonsacred material. Most of the Geniza papers–about 380,000 folio pages in all–are fragments of literary manuscripts, largely on religious subjects. But somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand fragments are what is usually termed documentary material; that is, they are everyday writings, texts written not to convey ideas to an anonymous and long-lasting audience but to communicate with specific recipients for immediate practical purposes." Goldberg and Krakowski, "Introduction: A Handbook for Documentary Geniza Research in the Twenty-First Century," Jewish History 32 (2019): 117-118.

Goitein already recognized the effects of this acculturative process on Cairo Geniza texts in the 1960s: Goitein, A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Genizah, Volume I (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 19.

[^3]: When "berakha / blessing" does not appear in the heading of these specific entries it can refer to the week of the final parsha reading "[Ve-Zot Ha-]Berakha."

[^4]: The abbreviation "ת׳׳ע / t[asāwī] ʿa[la]" in Judeo-Arabic translates as "amounting to" and thus precedes many numerical values (in this case to introduce monetary contributions).
