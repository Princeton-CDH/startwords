Online crowdsourcing—a series of methods for engaging volunteers with STEM, humanities, and cultural heritage research—has rapidly matured between 2000 and 2021.<!--more-->

These efforts have been led by research groups such as [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), platform designers such as [From the Page](https://fromthepage.com/), [Omeka](https://omeka.org/), [PyBossa](https://pybossa.com/) and [Scripto](https://scripto.org/), and cultural heritage institutions such as the [National Archives and Records Administration](https://www.archives.gov/) (NARA) and [Smithsonian](https://www.si.edu/). Volunteers help researchers, journalists, conservationists, cultural heritage practitioners and one another to gather data that contributes to real research, original art, policy, community health, and more. In this essay, we will focus on cultural heritage crowdsourcing, and transcription projects in particular. Typically, these projects invite volunteers to transcribe handwritten materials, or printed materials produced with ornate type or typewriter documents that are not amenable to handwritten text recognition (HTR) or optical character recognition (OCR), because of the slight irregularities of the type, faint ink, or use of thin papers such as onion skin.

Crowdsourcing transcription projects generally fall into one of two categories: those that are structured around a particular research problem or question, and those that gather data to enhance search and discovery of materials for open-ended and ongoing purposes. Whereas many researchers want to extract particular pieces of information from datasets, such as water salinity and temperature from old ships logs to feed data into climate change models ([Old Weather](https://www.oldweather.org/)), most cultural heritage crowdsourcing projects gather transcriptions of entire documents to support as-yet-unstipulated research purposes. Their goal is to create pathways for discovery in their Content Management Systems--the catalogs and other platforms that make metadata and images of original materials discoverable.

Transcriptions that reproduce the text on the page (as opposed to select pieces of data) have a variety of applications across numerous disciplines, and also have the power to solve two common challenges for researchers and the librarians and archivists who support them: 1) transcriptions speed up discovery, and 2) transcriptions can (if presented properly online) increase accessibility for those who cannot read the original handwriting, those who are blind or cognitively impaired and use a screen reader. Before we delve into a few case studies of organizations that have used crowdsourcing methods to generate text transcriptions for these purposes, we want to emphasize that both of these goals are widespread, and that, unfortunately, the barriers to achieving these goals are also widespread, and are not yet widely discussed.
