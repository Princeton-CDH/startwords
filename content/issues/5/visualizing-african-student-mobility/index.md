Some of the best material we have for understanding twentieth-century African migration to the United States is held within the archives of an African American educator. In 1959, Horace Mann Bond, then Dean of the School of Education at Atlanta University, set out to survey the historical relationship between African Americans and Africans. Key to his investigation was his interest in African students who had studied at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the U.S., starting as early as 1848. Drawing upon information provided by his vast network of fellow college administrators and presidents, Bond compiled over one thousand index cards, each documenting information on an African student.[^1] These cards are a critical resource for my research on the religious, racial, and political formation of African student migrants to the U.S. during the twentieth century.

The delight and difficulty I experienced while analyzing Bond's index cards quickly became somewhat of an obsession, not unlike the grip that African students held on Bond, leading him to describe his study as "the most fascinat\[ing\] endeavor" of his scholarly career.[^2] The breadth of information Bond collected is as remarkable today as it would have been then. Most index cards include the student's name, where in Africa they came from, the college or university they attended in the U.S., and the years in which the student was in enrolled at the school.[^3] Many cards also include miscellaneous notes such as the student's area of study, whether they returned to Africa, and their occupation. Of course, students were not the only kind of African migrants to the U.S. during the twentieth century.[^4] Nevertheless, examining this era of "transatlantic educational traffic" by placing African students in time and space presented an exciting opportunity to contribute to the growing body of research that examines transnational connections between Africans and African Americans.[^5]

There was just one major problem. Although the index cards presented a wealth of information, working with the data on the cards in their current form proved to be unwieldy. [Having repurposed a set of tabbed recipe card dividers, Bond roughly organized the index cards by educational institution]{.mark} with clear sections separating African students who attended Lincoln University from those who attended Howard University, for example. This way of organizing the data was perfectly suitable for beginning to answer some of Bond's driving research questions---questions that still preoccupy scholars of African student mobility: "Where did they come \[to in the U.S.\]? Why? Who sent them?"[^6] But what if you wanted to ask additional questions of Bond's data? What if, like me, you were curious about identifying trends in where African students came from and how the migration of African students might have changed over time?

*\[Images of the cards* *in PDF form?\]*

While images of the index cards have since been digitized, the data remains frozen in time. The text on the cards, a mixture of typewritten and handwritten scripts, cannot readily be processed by text recognition software.[^7] Moreover, the cards are still organized according to academic institutions, thus obstructing other ways of conceiving and ordering the data. Without the ability to easily reorganize and visualize the information on the cards, [the full potential of Bond's intellectual labor has yet to be fully realized.]{.mark} Undeterred by the messiness of the data, I sought to build upon Bond's work by creating a database of African student migrants and by mapping the migration of these students to Black colleges. The process of transforming the data on Bond's index cards into a usable form for further scholarly inquiry revealed that data visualization can be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamism of African migration to the U.S. during the twentieth century.

To fully grasp the significance of the data Bond collected, it is first important to understand the various contexts in which his study of African students emerged. Bond's tenure as president of his alma mater, Lincoln University, from 1945-1957 was one of the greatest sources of inspiration for his research. As the first African American president of the Pennsylvania institution, Bond inherited Lincoln's long-standing commitment to educating Black leaders. Founded in 1854 with a mission oriented toward "the redemption of Africa," Lincoln had enduring, if not complicated, connections to the continent. In its earliest years, the institution found support among organizations such as the American Colonization Society (ACS). ACS members like Reverend Cortlandt Van Rensselaer, a Presbyterian, hoped Lincoln (then called the Ashmun Institute) would train African Americans who could migrate to Liberia and "awaken new interest and render more effective" U.S. Christian efforts to "rescue" African heathens through Christianization and colonization.[^8]

During his term as president, Bond developed a keen interest in learning not only about African Americans who traveled to Africa as missionaries, but also African students who had come to the U.S. He corresponded with Lincoln alumni like Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana who both made names for themselves as leaders working toward decolonization in Africa. Bond concluded that, at Lincoln, men like Azikiwe and Nkrumah "received a kind of spiritual education almost impossible for any person from any colony to receive anywhere else in the world." Furthermore, [African students' encounters with African Americans---"a great, black minority, that was in process of struggling for their rights"---Bond argued, were key to the racial and political formation of these nationalist leaders.]{.mark}[^9]

*\[Images: Bond in Nigeria; Bond with Nkrumah; Bond with Azikiwe\]*

Bond's connections with African students even gave him the opportunity to see Africa for himself. In 1949, at the invitation of Lincoln alumnus Kingsley Ozumba Mbadiwe, Bond traveled to Nigeria---the first of at least ten visits Bond would make to West Africa over the course of eight years. Mbadiwe hoped that Bond, as president of the institution that nurtured so many of Africa's emerging leaders, could help garner support for the African Academy of Arts and Research (AAAR). Founded by Mbadiwe, AAAR hoped to raise funds for Africans to study in the U.S.[^10] Although some students, faculty, and members of the Board of Trustees at Lincoln worried that Bond's attention to Africa might distract him from matters at his home institution, his travels and connections to African students only fueled his determination to trace the history of African students in the U.S..[^11]

Beyond his personal affiliation with African students, Bond's curiosity about the relationship between Black educational institutions and Africa was further informed by the U.S. racial and political climate. In the years following the 1954 *Brown v. Board* *of Education* Supreme Court decision, Black educational leaders like Bond increasingly debated and defended the significance of predominantly Black colleges and universities in the context of desegregation. Speaking at a United Negro College Fund conference in October 1959, James S. Thomas of the Methodist Church's Board of Education posed several questions outlining the stakes of HBCUs in the era of desegregation by encouraging attendees to answer questions like: "What is the Negro college now doing that cannot better be done by any other institution, perhaps at less cost?. . . Is there any one thing which Negro colleges did for their students without which all of America would be poorer?"[^12] For Bond, one way of demonstrating the domestic significance of Black institutions was to highlight how Black colleges and universities served a global purpose.

In the context of geopolitical conflicts during the Cold War and increasing calls for African independence, U.S. religious, political, and educational organizations intensified their gaze toward Africa, wondering whether those on the continent would be friends or foes of U.S. interests. Convinced that the attitudes of African students in the U.S. could make or break the future of U.S.-Africa relations, organizations such as the Phelps-Stokes Fund kept a close eye on African student experiences.

In their 1949 "Survey of African Students Studying in the United States," the organization assessed the level of "confidence and trust" between "British West African students" and U.S. educational and philanthropic organizations. Of particular interest were "the advantages and disadvantages of students studying north and south of the Mason-Dixon line." Surveyors often questioned whether HBCUs (primarily located in the South) helped or hindered African students' perceptions of the U.S. Many also suggested that HBCUs offered an inferior educational experience compared to other schools. Challenged by the geopolitical questions surrounding African education in the U.S., Bond set out to conduct his own study---one he hoped would demonstrate that Black colleges and universities were in fact an ideal place for nurturing leaders of emerging African countries.[^13]

*\[Image: Cover page of Bond's text "The African Student in the Negro College"\]*

Speaking at the United Negro College Fund's conference in 1959, Bond outlined his proposed research on "The African Student in the United States." Arguing that predominantly Black colleges "represent in their own country, and in the World, the hopes and aspirations" of African Americans and Africans alike, Bond insisted that members of the Fund "unite in study and action" to support African education in the U.S. He clarified that HBCUs were the first institutions to demonstrate an interest in educating Africans and thus had a historical and moral responsibility to invest their time and resources in supporting their ancestral kin. Thus, after gaining financial support from the United Negro College Fund and the Phelps-Stokes Fund, Bond wrote to over twenty registrars and deans of predominantly Black colleges to collect further evidence that Black institutions had a role to play not only in the U.S., but in the world.[^14]

Transforming the data on Bond's cards into a database and several maps came with its own set of challenges. Still, as others have noted, data visualizations do not simply "do our work for us, but rather to point to where our work lies."[^15] The process of reorganizing the data for scholarly use has provided helpful insights and raised several questions that I hope to further interrogate in my research.

*\[Image: Screenshot of the database? Not sure where this should* *go...\]*

After transcribing the text on the cards, I soon realized that, although Bond accumulated over one thousand index cards, about one-fourth of them were duplicates. Many African students began their education at one institution in the U.S. and either transferred to other schools to complete their undergraduate education or pursued graduate or medical school training at other institutions. The internal mobility of African students in the U.S. meant that some appeared in the records of multiple institutions, generating multiple cards that highlight different moments in a student's educational journey. Following initial rounds of data cleaning, I turned to additional archival materials to determine which duplicate entries did indeed refer to the same students.

*\[Image: Fatima Massaquoi and her duplicate cards?\]*

In doing so, I dove deeper into the lives of lesser-known students whose narratives helpfully open a window onto the experiences of students other than paradigmatic figures such as Azikiwe, Nkrumah, and other statesmen. One such student was Fatima Massaquoi. Hailing from Liberia, Fatima was not the first in her family to study in the U.S. Her father, Momolu Massaquoi, attended the Methodist Episcopal Church's Central Tennessee College (later called Walden University) in 1888. In 1937, Fatima migrated to the U.S. to attend Lane College, an HBCU in Tennessee, which was led by a former classmate of her father's. Fatima would later attend Fisk University where she began writing her autobiography. Her rich narrative describes her upbringing in West Africa, her schooling in Germany, and her experiences in the U.S. [As one of the relatively few women who studied in the U.S. during the twentieth century, Fatima's narrative, among others, invites questions regarding the role of gender in mediating the migratory experiences of African students.]{.mark}[^16]

Beyond the issue of duplicates, I also needed to standardize the country names indicating where African students came from. Given the temporal range of Bond's study, covering the period of 1848-1960, the names of some African countries changed over time. For example, for the sake of clarity, I modified entries listing student origins as the "Gold Coast" to instead read "Ghana," while entries like "Congo Free State" and "Congo Independent State" became "Congo." Moreover, the names of territories listed in the data such as Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Tanganyika (Tanzania), and Nyasaland (Malawi) which are not found on present-day maps reflect Africa's colonial history. Did the ebbs and flows of various African independence movements influence how and whether African students articulated national identities? Under what circumstances did students emphasize their identities as "Africans" rather than highlight the particularities of their colonial or national context? What purpose(s) did these identifications serve? Such questions come into view when restructuring the data and considering the discursive, social, and cultural implications of Africa's shifting political landscape.

Finally, I had to reckon with the incompleteness of Bond's data. Because of Bond's focus on HBCUs, the data should not be seen as a comprehensive record of African students in the U.S. Nor should the data be viewed as a complete listing of the institutions African students attended. Apart from a few cards representing students who attended "white colleges," Bond did not include the trajectories of African students when they attended non-HBCU schools. Exceptions were schools like Oberlin College and Otterbein University which, although they were not HBCUs, were historically significant for having educated several African students during the late nineteenth century. As a result, Bond's data only shows part of the trajectories of some students. Nigerian student Simon Anekwe, for example is included in Bond's records as having attended Lincoln University. However, the other parts of Anekwe's time in the U.S.---his stints at St. John's University, Columbia, and Fordham---are not included.

ยง *\[Image: Point-to-point map of student migration using Palladio\]*

Mapping the trajectories of African students who studied at HBCUs reveals the dynamic nature of African migration during the twentieth century. Zooming out from Bond's interest in HBCUs to see the transatlantic movement of students from Africa to the U.S. reveals the continental scope of African student mobility. To be sure, the vast majority of students came from five primary countries: Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, and Ghana. Still, the range of student origins suggests that African student migration to the U.S. presented opportunities not only for African Americans and Africans to interact, but also for African students to interact with students from other African countries. Organizations like the African Students\' Association of the United States and Canada, formed at Lincoln in 1941, provided opportunities for African students to foster community along shared cultural lines and to cultivate solidarity around their shared struggles against colonialism and toward independence. The development of these student diasporas presents new ways of thinking about the various kinds of pan-African connections that were cultivated during the twentieth century.[^17]

Visualizing African student mobility in this way also affords the possibility of identifying changes in African student migration over time. Prior to World War II, African American missionary connections to Africa played a significant role in facilitating the migration of students from Liberia and South Africa.

*\[Image: Map of students from South Africa to the U.S. before WWII; Map of students from South Africa to the U.S. after WWII\]*

The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in particular, by building missions and schools in South Africa during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth, is largely responsible for paving the way for South African students to attend schools like Wilberforce University in Ohio and the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama.[^18] As African American missionary activity in Africa had dwindled by the 1930s, so did the number of Black South Africans attending HBCUs.

*\[Image:* *Map of students* *from Nigeria to the U.S. before Azikiwe's return to Nigeria; Map of students from Nigeria to the U.S. in the decade following Azikiwe's return\]*

Mapping African student migration to the U.S. also allows us to visualize the impact that U.S.-educated Africans had on fellow Africans back home. After attending Lincoln, the University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia University, Azikiwe returned to Nigeria in 1934. By 1937, after establishing the nationalist newspaper the *West African Pilot*, Azikiwe supported a group of Nigerian men in their pursuit of education in the U.S. Often referred to as "the Argonauts," the group of students included Kingsley Mbadiwe, his brother George Mbadiwe, Nwafor Orizu, and Mbonu Ojike.[^19] All of the men began their education at Azikiwe's beloved Lincoln University. Their presence at the school would inspire future generations of Nigerian students to look to the U.S. for higher education. The proportion of African students hailing from Nigeria increased dramatically after Azikiwe's return to his home country and would continue into the 1960s, in no small part due to the influence of other Nigerian students.

While mapping illuminated some things about African student migration to HBCUs, there were other factors influencing African student mobility that mapping obscures or makes more difficult to visualize. For relative ease of viewing, these maps illustrate the first institution each student attended. As mentioned previously, students often attended more than one institution during their stay in the U.S. Thus, [while the point-to-point trajectories on the map suggest linear movement from Africa to a single destination in the U.S., the migratory journeys of students were often far more complicated.]{.mark} In many cases, students' movement from one institution to another in the U.S. was the result of students demonstrating their agency by advocating for the kind of education they wanted to receive.

Simon Anekwe, originally from Nigeria, followed the footsteps of the well-known American-educated Nigerian Nnamdi Azikiwe, as well as many other Nigerians, and enrolled at Lincoln in 1948. However, as a devout Catholic, Anekwe found the Presbyterian orientation of Lincoln did not provide him with an education that would help him achieve his larger goal of starting a Catholic newspaper in Nigeria. As a result, Anekwe wrote to John LaFarge, a highly regarded Catholic leader who was known for aiding Catholic African students. After writing to LaFarge about his predicament, Anekwe received a tuition waver to take courses at the School of Education at Fordham University, a Catholic institution, and went on to attend Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism through a grant offered by the U.S. government, which LaFarge recommended.[^20]

*\[Image: Anekwe's letter(s) to John LaFarge\]*

Although scholarship assistance and connections between Lincoln and Nigeria made it possible for some students to attend Lincoln, students like Anekwe still had a say in their migratory experiences. Indeed, "even if student mobility has been greatly conditioned by global contexts and by institutional actors, students have also contributed to shaping the nature, meaning and scope of their mobility."[^21] Understanding how students might have leveraged religious networks like those between Anekwe and LaFarge opens new avenues for thinking about the role of religion in African student mobility. In future iterations of this mapping project, I hope to incorporate additional data that allows for the visualization of such religious connections.

Visualizing Bond's data through the African student database and accompanying maps is useful for thinking about African migration in new ways. The fact that many African students found their way to HBCUs has not gone unnoticed by scholars of African student mobility. Scholars have previously highlighted the role of African American missionaries in the migration of Africans to U.S. institutions of higher learning.[^22] So too have scholars examined how U.S. philanthropic organizations such as the Phelps Stokes Fund and scholarship schemes such as the African Scholarship Program of American Universities contributed to the presence of African students at U.S. colleges and universities.[^23] Still, visualizing the data on Bond's cards reveals the larger scope and contingencies which informed African student migration during the twentieth century---beyond any one institution, philanthropic organization, or African nationality.

While scholars have typically focused on the post-1965 migration of Africans to the U.S. following the Hart-Celler Act, my project draws attention to the migration of earlier African migrants whose experiences deserve further attention. Admittedly, the relatively meager number of African students in the U.S. before the 1960s pales in comparison to the over two million African migrants who live in the U.S. today.[^24] However, the small numbers do not tell the full story. That philanthropic, educational, and political leaders from all over the country did what they could to accommodate African students tells us that Africans loomed larger in the American imagination than the numbers suggest. In the case of Bond, African students in the U.S. reflected a longer history of African diasporic encounters. Their presence also highlighted the vital contribution of Black institutions in the forging of pan-Africanist networks.
