When I was growing up I liked to read about dying children. I’m not talking about the Victorian orphan kind of dying either, not the dying of storybooks, but children (well, teenagers) who were terminally ill.

I was twelve and fixated on books written by an author with the implausible name of Lurlene McDaniel. The first book I encountered was Six Months to Live, which chronicled the life a popular teenager in the wake of her diagnosis with leukemia. McDaniel’s characters didn’t just have cancer; they wrestled with all kinds of chronic illnesses (cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, diabetes) as well as the untimely death of loved ones from causes including suicide. They were books about grief and communities formed in times of crisis. These books would have been perfect for a budding hypochondriac, or for a reader given to purple prose and melodrama, but I read them for the medical details, taking mental notes on how to diagnose various signs and symptoms and stockpiling already-outdated knowledge about treatment options. Rather than imagining myself as the protagonist, I occupied the position of the doctor. If this sounds like a perfect setup for attending medical school, it was. I didn’t, but that’s a different story. It turned out, though, that I’d would have to be the protagonist anyway. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer in January 2019. I was thirty-four at the time, with zero family history and no warning signs aside from the lump I hoped fervently would be mastitis. Immediately, I was launched into a world at once familiar and alien. I had grown up knowing many doctors and research scientists in the community at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, largely because my father, an emeritus professor of philosophy, is a medical ethicist with an abiding interest in the practical applications of the questions his work investigates. I had worked in a research laboratory there myself from ages sixteen to twenty, studying—of all things—the genetics of breast cancer. Is it any wonder, then, that I explored my own treatment options as though I were the physician or researcher rather than the patient? The type of breast cancer I have (triple negative) is particularly rare and intractable and at the most advanced stage already, with metastasis to my lungs, liver, and bones, finding promising clinical trials would be my best option. Research science would save me, if only I could find the right study. My immediate family (all three of us academics) and circle of friends (ditto) kicked into research mode. We agreed that my best chance at coping with cancer as a chronic illness was to make sure I was research subject, to transform my body as rapidly as possible into the right kind of data: not a mortality statistic but an experimental space. As I made phone calls to oncologists and combed through clinicaltrials.gov I performed a distancing maneuver I had been practicing since I was reading Lurlene McDaniel; I wasn’t the patient, facing a foreshortened life, but the doctor who could change the situation. As a coping mechanism, and a way to regain some sense of agency, it was a pretty good one. It also, however, involved a fair bit of alienation from my own body, as I mentally dissected it, narrowing it down to cancerous focal points that became all that mattered. I lay repeatedly in CT and MRI scanners and held my breath through biopsies with only local anesthetics, willing myself out of the body I was at the same time trying so hard to save.

 Cancer is invisible and so are data.  Neither exists in the sense of being detectable, nameable, or identifiable until plucked from the surroundings and marked out with a significance determined by the observer. It is, as Johanna Drucker’s 2011 essay suggests, perhaps more accurate to think of data as capta to indicate their situatedness—that they are seized and, from the very moment of demarcation, cannot exist independent of an interpretive viewpoint: “Realist approaches depend above all upon an idea that phenomena are observer-independent and can be characterized as data. Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori conditions.” Drucker goes on to offer a humanist critique of data visualization that resists the assumption of “transparency and equivalence, as if the phenomenal world were self-evident and the apprehension of it a mere mechanical task.” The other essay in this issue has explored and critiqued data visualization from another perspective, challenging readers to “defamiliarize our eyes from many of the two-dimensional data representations we have seen” since “there is something unique about turning data points into physical forms and placing them in spaces that trigger the mind to understand data in a distinctive way.” Both pieces trouble the notion of data as objective by reemphasizing the subjective position of the observer (or “experiencer”) and the phenomenological roots of data itself, refusing to conflate observation with that which is observed. Knowledge resists fixity, for it is as variable as the permutations of observer, method(s) of perception, and communication of experience. Additionally, both concern transforming abstractions—data—into concrete representations, in two and three dimensions. This piece takes the other side of that humanist coin, returning to the process by which an abstraction is generated from the concrete: the physical body. The phenomenon known as “cancer” is at its foundation a collection of data points. We are not able to call something “cancer,” to mark it out from its surroundings and imbue it with significance, until it becomes observable, capturable. Often this is in the most concretely physical way, since the mutated cells frequently aren’t detectable until they have begun to mass into a palpable tumor. There is quite literally a critical mass of cancer cells required before they can even be named, marked out into normal and alien, self and not-self. But cancer exists before it is named, just like data, and even at its moment of detection (capture) its fixity is illusory as its very nature is to grow and change, just like data. The moment of visibility for both is firmly situated in time, place, and the subject position of the interpreter. Nowhere may this phenomenon be more evident than in the transformation of the body into data through technologies—CT and MRI scans—that apparently render the solid mass of the body transparent, making invisible masses of cells detectable. Yet, as is evident from the chart below, [I want to do some kind of chart/visualization of my CT scan results to show how variable and inconsistent the data are..] results from mechanical processes must still be interpreted by people so that, among other things, images can be translated into the more human-accessible format of measurements and numbers. The subjectivity of these interpretations means that scan results are just as much capta as data and just as much vulnerable to positional bias. Take, for example, the open question of how extensively cancer may have spread to my liver. Unusually, as a result of a years-long chronic fatigue for which I still have no good explanation, I was actually tested for cancer in 2016. The bone marrow biopsy showed no cause for concern and even though there was a lesion on my liver, measuring 29mm x 28 mm, the conclusion was that it was a benign growth called a hemangioma and that I did not have cancer. (I stand by this view, if for no other reason than that it would have gotten significantly worse in the intervening three years given how aggressive it has been.) My first CT after diagnosis in January 2019 showed the lesion to be 29mm x 35mm, a finding that the radiologist remarked might represent growth (and therefore metastasis) or might not, since a difference of 6mm could be caused by different positioning during the scan or different measurements by different doctors. The lesion continued to remain stable on my next CTs, but in March 2019 an additional spot was detected on the right inferior lobe, measuring 12mm. By June 2019 that spot was reported to be 28mm, confirming that my liver had been affected. By December 2019 it was smaller than 5mm. A third spot on the left lobe was recorded in 3 scans, showing up as 5mm August 2019, 4mm in September, and 3mm in November. By December 2019 it went unremarked. The large lesion from 2016, however, merely waxed and waned, never clocking in at more than 35mm or fewer than 27mm, easily numbers attributable to variation in imaging or interpretation of results. So was the original lesion a benign hemangioma, or the first sign of an otherwise invisible cancer hiding out in individual, unmassed (and therefore undetectable) cells? Did the 2016 scan produce bad data, or rather bad capta? Was the interpretation of the image biased by the fact that I was young (31) and, aside from mysterious, debilitating fatigue, healthy? Should I have acted differently? Should my doctors? The ramifications of these questions for my diagnosis and emotional response to it are profound: a cancer that had been present since 2016 would look relatively less aggressive compared to one that was new as of 2019; being misdiagnosed and living with cancer for three years would compound my fear that it was preventable. There is no way to know, though the probability is strong that it was and remains benign. But that uncertainty is the constant condition of the body as data. Any promise of transparency or intelligibility must be counterbalanced by the knowledge that all data have a viewpoint because they have an observer.

As of writing this essay, it’s been 14 months since my diagnosis. I have tried three different treatments, two of which were clinical trials, one of which I am still enrolled in. It is about a week before my thirty-sixth birthday and everyone is sheltering in place because of the coronavirus. I have lived more than a year now tolerating the same kind of existential uncertainty and fear of an alien invader in the body that the world as a whole is now experiencing. I have played my own doctor, watching my body for signs that a treatment is working, or that it is not, in much the same way. I have tried to anticipate what will happen if I become immunocompromised (as I currently am not, but may become) and given up many of the pleasures that made my life better before (traveling, going out with friends, dating) in the name of my health. I have offered my body up as data to research scientists with the goal of furthering not just my own treatment but the survival prospects for future patients. I did not know that throughout this year I was in training for a time when we would all of necessity be regarded as bodies with the potential to produce valuable data about the spread and effects of COVID-19. We are starved for numbers, for data on infections and recoveries and for statistical models that may relieve us the uncertainty we feel about the future. I cannot provide that. But I can tell you to be cautious readers of data and statistics that speak with any pretense to authority right now, even though I crave them too. Cancer is invisible and so are viruses. This particular virus can inhabit the body but produce no symptom and live for days on surfaces. It may be in us. It may be in those we love. We are in the middle of the data. We are the data. Susan Sontag wrote in Illness as Metaphor that “Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place” (3). A pandemic transcends borders but does not do away with the kingdom of the sick. As someone already resident, I can say to you welcome. The hardest thing about being here is the grief for what we have lost, including a sense of normalcy. The best thing, though, is what we may find: community in a time of crisis.
