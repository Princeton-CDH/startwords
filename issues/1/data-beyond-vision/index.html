both be seen as steps in this direction: they provide venues for the review and publication of data and software, respectively, accompanied by brief ‚Äúmetapapers‚Äù; but even these rely on transforming the content they review (data and software) into text in order to function! What are the implications if we truly expand the range of accepted scholarly outputs to include such interpretive objects as data structures, databases, software, datasets, physical objects, augmented reality experiences? Will all scholars need to become experts in all these modes, or can we find a way to be conversant, as with other important scholarly theories?</p><p>SEE

Call them maker statements, perhaps. These are our attempts to communicate our goals and help you read and interpret these unfamiliar objects and be challenged by the potential of physicalizations.</p><p>Data physicalization focuses on constructing data in physical form. It may be similar to other approaches in that it helps to understand and represent data, and in its use of the senses to communicate information, mainly through touch and sight. However, there are considerable distinctions among these approaches. What makes data physicalization distinct is that it encourages critical making by bridging the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration. This matters because not only does it surfaces the amount of labor involved with data production and representation, and put it into different perspectives and dimensions; it can also creates an opportunity for viewers to become participants by taking part in the making of a piece using data.</p><p>Data Physicalization attempts to defamiliarize our eyes from many of the two-dimensional data representations we have seen, and put us ‚Äúin the middle of data‚Äù. There is something unique about turning data points into physical forms and placing them in space that triggers the mind to understand data in a distinctive way.</p><p>Making use of other senses can provide a step towards greater accessibility. The typical solution for making data visualization accessible to vision-impaired readers is to provide a table with the data underlying the chart or graph. This isn‚Äôt practical for large datasets, and it‚Äôs clearly not the same experience, or otherwise we would provide the tabular data to all users. Another approach is to provide an extended description of the insights gained from the chart. This is helpful, but pre-digesting the chart in this way doesn‚Äôt allow readers to view and interpret the patterns and draw their own conclusions.</p><p>We invite you to participate in the labor of data work.

We wanted to highlight the activity of the relatively unknown members ‚Äî frequently women - who in fact represent a much larger portion of the library's day-to-day activity and thus arguably better represent it. The piece makes use of unit origami to create a larger, cohesive form from small folded units, mirroring the relationship between a single member and the greater bulk of the library.</p><h3 id=description>Description</h3><p>The physicalization contrasts the activity of the well-known members of the library (those linked by researchers to an entry in VIAF) with the activity of its relatively unknown members (no known authority records). Activity is represented by the total number of recorded events that would plausibly have brought members into the library - checking out, renewing, and returning books. By holding the physicalization in two different ways, the user can &ldquo;grasp&rdquo; two separate sets of data: the octahedron (non-famous members) and the cube (famous members). The ratio of the volumes of these two solids is equal to the ratio of the two datasets.</p><h3 id=insights>Insights</h3><p>A pie chart can be used to present the same ratio of data conveyed in the physicalization. &mldr;.</p><h4 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h4><p>Using cut, punched, or embossed paper would make the piece more tactile; instead of simply printing names, unique patterns could be added to represent data for individual members. In the future, we could generate unique folding patterns for individual library member activity and make them available via print-on-demand, which would enable viewers to become participants and turn folding into an act of recovery of the unknown library members.</p><p>Nick Budak, Xinyi Li</p><hr><h2 id=modeling-shakespeare-and-company-library-membership>Modeling Shakespeare and Company Library Membership</h2><h3 id=goal-1>Goal</h3><p>This data physicalization demonstrates the affordances of three dimensions for representing data: time series data are displayed with sequential months and years adjacent to each other, which makes it easier to discern seasonal and annual trends. I hope to inspire others to try experimental approaches to representing data; writing software to generate printable 3D models directly from the data makes the process reproducible, and may eventually enable others to create and print their own physicalizations. The tactile nature of the object suggests the possibilities of 3D printing to create more accessible representations of data.</p><h3 id=description-1>Description</h3><p>This is a two variable, three dimensional lollipop chart showing the membership of the Shakespeare and Company library by month and year, from November 1919 when Sylvia Beach opened her bookstore to its official closing in 1942. Membership data is drawn from two different sources, both of which are incomplete: broad subscription information comes from <a href=https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/logbooks/>logbooks</a> (although logbooks for 1930 and parts of 1931-32 are missing); detailed borrowing histories come from <a href=https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/cards/>lending library cards</a> for a subset of members. The white represents the number of members with an active subscription in each month; the green<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> corresponds to the number of members with borrowing activity in each month. For any month where the value is zero, there is no lollipop. Representing the two different datasets as adjacent half lollipops exposes the discrepancies between the stories these sources tell us about the membership of the library without privileging either of them. The two lollipop charts are designed to be printed independently and then assembled, so that any 3D printer can be used; however, this is a prototype and the design needs further revision.</p><h3 id=insights-1>Insights</h3><p>The same data can be presented in a two-variable bar chart. Overall trends are easy to see, but seasonal trends are not as distinct. Changing perspective on the physical object allows focusing on yearly or monthly trends. Missing data in one variable is visible in both &mldr; [TBD]</p><h3 id=next-steps-1>Next Steps</h3><p>The current version uses different shapes for the two variables, but adding textures would make the model even more tactile. Simple 3D labels with text and braille have been added for display alongside the piece, but perhaps they could incorporated directly on the model, and refined to provide a scale for the axes. The 3D printed objects could also be augmented with other media: lights or sound could convey intensity of borrowing activity, or threads connecting months to represent the number of subscription renewals and convey a sense of continuity. The Python code used to create these models could be generalized for reuse, and eventually made available as a Blender plugin.</p><p>Rebecca Sutton Koeser</p><hr><h2 id=weaving-derridas-references>Weaving Derrida‚Äôs references</h2><blockquote><p>‚Ä¶ we all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors‚Ä¶
‚Äî George Eliot, Middlemarch</p></blockquote><h3 id=goal-2>Goal</h3><p>With this piece, we aim to literalize the metaphor of weaving as writing by representing Derrida‚Äôs intertextuality as a woven tapestry. The textures of the yarn and woven fabric invite touch, but by showing an in-progress weaving with the pattern and instructions provided, we move viewers beyond seeing and touching to enable them to become participants in reconstructing the data. Showing the weaving in progress also foregrounds the labor of data work, since curation, collection, and visualization all take an enormous amount of work and skill, often from a range of different individuals.</p><h3 id=description-2>Description</h3><p>This weaving represents the references in chapter one of Jacques Derrida‚Äôs de la Grammatologie. The references have been cataloged and categorized by researchers for Derrida‚Äôs Margins. Each type of reference (epigraph, citation, quotation, footnote) is represented by a distinct yarn and weaving pattern. Derrida‚Äôs highly intertextual writing suggested the idea of weaving, and using yarn to symbolize the foundational work of deconstructionism, which operates by finding the place where a text unravels, gives additional depth to this physicalization. Textile work is often stereotyped as women‚Äôs work, so this piece also raises questions of gender, art versus craft, and high tech versus low tech.</p><h3 id=insights-2>Insights</h3><p>[tbd]</p><h3 id=next-steps-2>Next Steps</h3><p>Adding conductive thread and sensors could turn the weaving into an interface, so that touching the fabric would bring up the relevant reference on an associated screen. Data weavings could also be augmented with other media, such as lights and sound to convey other aspects of the same or related data. Incorporating other work on automated weaving and knitting machines would add to the variety of options for data textiles.</p><p>Rebecca Sutton Koeser, Gissoo Doroudian</p><hr><h2 id=stacking-new-and-continuing-membership-activities-of-shakespeare-and-company-library>Stacking New and Continuing Membership Activities of Shakespeare and Company Library</h2><h3 id=goal-3>Goal</h3><p>This piece aims to reveal the continuity and growth of Sylvia Beach‚Äôs lending library by showing the extent of activity and recorded membership based on logbooks and lending cards. Multiple variables are encoded in the dimensions of stacking boxes based on the technique of pop-up box folds. By exhibiting the evolution of the library over time while contrasting activities of new and old patrons, this piece enables multiple ways to compare and interpret the data from diverse perspectives. By transforming a flat surface to a three-dimensional form with play of light and shadows, this production technique serves as a metaphor for the purpose of larger Shakespeare and Company Project‚Äî bringing archival data to life and facilitating rich interpretations</p><h3 id=description-3>Description</h3><p>Shakespeare and Company Project library membership data from 1919 to 1941 are represented as a hybrid of time-series and stacked bar charts showing part-to-whole relationship made from paper and folding. Each unit, a cuboid in space and sometimes its stacking child, represents one year and displays nine variables for that year. The height corresponds to the number of active subscribers recorded in the logbooks; the depth depicts the number of members with borrowing activity, according to each member‚Äôs lending library card; the length along the timeline is based on the total number of borrowing events. Each of the variables is split into two parts: previous patrons who have renewed a subscription contrasted with new members. The upper portion shows the growth and the activities of new readers. Viewers can see the rise and fall of subscribers, inspect the difference between active borrowers and subscribers, compare the growth over time by viewing the stacking part from the front, and survey the involvement of continuing members versus new patrons, to name a few possibilities. In some cases, a small number of new members were very active readers based on their borrowing activity. Data was mapped to the shapes with Data Illustrator, semi-manual calculation and vector drawing.</p><h3 id=insights-3>Insights</h3><p>[tbd]</p><h3 id=next-steps-3>Next Steps</h3><p>The data encoding process could be automated by writing custom code, which could then be made available as a tool for presenting part-to-whole relationships. With the addition of time-based media such as projection mapping, this piece could convey more context and narratives around the lending library.</p><p>Xinyi Li</p><hr><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Staley, David. ‚ÄúOn the ‚ÄòMaker Turn‚Äô in the Humanities.‚Äù In Making Things and Drawing Boundaries, edited by Jentery Sayers, 32‚Äì41.
