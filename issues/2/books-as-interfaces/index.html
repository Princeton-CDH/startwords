<a href=/issues/2/books-as-interfaces/index.txt rel=alt>TXT</a><h1 id=background>BACKGROUND</h1><h2 id=technical-field>Technical Field</h2><p>The invention generally relates to the field of elec tronic books and, more particularly, to systems and methods for accessing and otherwise working with book information via electronic devices. 0004 2. Background Information 0005. Even as widespread use of the Web reaches its twen tieth anniversary, there has been little change in how people make use of textbooks. Students still fill their backpacks with as many of the five-pound books as will fit, and the impact of Such paper-based learning is felt not only in students backs, but in the carbon footprint of all of the infrastructure required to Supply, use and dispose of such materials. A change of just a few pages in a textbook may make it obsolete and call for a new version to be printed; students carry not just this week&rsquo;s chapters with them everywhere, but last months and next month&rsquo;s chapters as well. 0006 Although some attempts have been made to trans form study material from Gutenberg&rsquo;s era to the digital era, Some of the advantages of using paper books for study pur poses have not been replicated. Students from time immemo rial have used their texts in different ways. Some highlight portions of particular interest; others place notes in the mar gins to keep track of clarifications of difficult concepts. Some used textbooks are more useful than new ones because they naturally fall open to the most important pages after repeated use, or because particularly important pages or sections are more dog-eared than others. Electronic reading devices have not to date provided interfaces to implement some of these subtle yet important features that help students learn from their texts most efficiently. 0007. It would be advantageous to provide improved inter face mechanisms for students to obtain, read, study from, and otherwise use textbook content with some of the tablet, laptop and other electronic devices that are now entering widespread SC. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 0008. An electronic book reader including input recogni tion, annotation, and collaboration Subsystems. Improved interaction methods provide more intuitive use of electronic books for studying. The provided annotation functionality allows a reader (e.g. a student) to make notes as is common with conventional paper books. The collaboration subsystem provides functionality to share these notes with others, enabling group learning on a variety of scales, from Small study groups to collaborations with worldwide scope. 0009. In one aspect, the electronic book reader is config ured to provide tabs or other interface controls through which a user can access a syllabus for a particular course, corre sponding textbooks, the student&rsquo;s own electronic notebook for the course, and lecture material (whether actual audio/ Aug. 30, 2012 video of the lecture, a slide deck used with the lecture, or related materials from the lecture). 0010. In one aspect, the reader is configured to facilitate navigation through a textbook by providing various user options for provisionally or tentatively moving through the text, for instance to temporarily move to a glossary section before returning to the maintext, or temporarily moving from a question page to a portion of the main text relating to the question. By using Suitable gestures, the student navigates between these options in a provisional fashion that allows easy return to the main section of interest. In a related aspect, a bookmarking system facilitates easy access to portions the student identifies as important. 0011. In a further aspect, the reader is configured to allow a student to attach annotations to an electronic textbook, in much the same way as a student might write notes in a con ventional paper textbook. These notes can take on a wider range of forms than is possible conventionally. For example, a student can attach audio and video as well as more tradi tional textual annotations. In a related aspect, the reader is configured to provide tools for converting student annotations into computer searchable and manipulatable form. 0012. In yet another aspect, the reader is configured to communicate with an accelerometer Subsystem on the user&rsquo;s computer to allow the user to &ldquo;pour annotations off of, or onto, the user&rsquo;s view of the textbook to either remove clutter or provide annotations as the user may require at any particu lar time. The reader is configured to permit students to show all annotations, to show only certain annotations, to margin alize annotations, or to hide all annotations as preferred at any particular time.</p></article></main><footer><nav aria-label="footer links"><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li></ul></nav></footer></body></html>
