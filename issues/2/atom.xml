<p>This piece is about making in support of making. It is about projects born from myriad goals that gather new objectives along their lifecycle, through evaluation and iteration.</p>
<p>This piece is about translating: from concept to design to product; from fragment to image to text; from high-level goal to incremental steps. It is about workflows and spin-offs and objectives; it is about unraveling a tapestry to learn how to spin its yarn.</p>
<p>In <em>Data Feminism</em>, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein use the example of the proliferation of street signs to make a point about making: <em>“One does not need street names for navigation until one has strangers in the landscape</em>” (italics in the original).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In D’Ignazio and Klein’s usage, the “strangers” here are data scientists, digging through data with which they are not intimately familiar. In this piece, we use our experience as platform maintainers to illustrate how all collaborators and participants are “strangers” at one point or another in the process of research development;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> it is only through collective building that we can successfully name our streets.</p>
<p>The framework for our discussion will be <a href="https://www.scribesofthecairogeniza.org"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em></a>, a crowdsourcing project hosted on the Zooniverse platform.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <em>Scribes</em> invites members of the public to engage deeply with the Cairo Geniza corpus: hundreds of thousands of manuscript fragments written in Hebrew and Arabic script, found in an Egyptian synagogue and dating mostly from the tenth to thirteenth centuries CE.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The project is a collaboration between the Zooniverse team and a group of specialists from the Judaica Digital Humanities program at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries (as well as a consortium of partner institutions).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Though a collaborative effort, each of the lead institutions brought their own goals to this project.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> For the Penn team, the original goal was to fully digitize the Geniza corpus through transcription of the fragment texts by a nonspecialist audience. The Zooniverse team came to the <em>Scribes</em> partnership as part of a larger research and development effort, “Transforming Libraries and Archives through Crowdsourcing,” which aimed to expand the resources available on the Zooniverse platform to better support galleries, libraries, archives, and museums in their efforts to create and run crowdsourcing projects.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>This piece will trace the history of this partnership, focusing on the interplay between often-competing elements of Digital Humanities (henceforth DH) collaboration: optimization and engagement, experience and outcome. In our attempts to balance the demands of infrastructure against the practice of paleography, what can we, as collaborators, learn about the process?</p>
<p>Throughout the piece, we have provided interludes in which we will walk you through the process of creating clickable keyboards for transcribing Hebrew script. Please feel free to interact with the example keyboards. You can try the full version by visiting <a href="https://www.scribesofthecairogeniza.org"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em></a> and choosing the Easy Hebrew transcription workflow.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> You can read the interludes in their entirety and view the source code on <a href="https://shaunanoordin.github.io/zooniverse-startwords/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="kb1">01. The Basics: A Form With Some Text Input</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by setting up a very basic web form. It has one text input field, one submit button, and one output panel.</p>
<iframe title="Basic Input Form" id="kb-s01" src="/issues/2/strangers-in-the-landscape/zooniverse-interludes/section-01.html"></iframe>
<p>Everything we build from this point onwards is meant to solve one very simple problem: <strong>how do we allow users to type, into that text input field, in a language that&rsquo;s not native to their keyboard?</strong> For example, how do we help a user type in the text &ldquo;ごはんを食べる&rdquo; when they only have a US-International QWERTY keyboard, and we don’t want to ask them to futz about in their computer settings to install a Japanese language pack?</p>

<h2 id="communal-making-and-collective-building">Communal Making and Collective Building</h2>
<p>When we build public crowdsourcing projects, the work we do as platform builders/maintainers is intended to facilitate research goals without sacrificing the experience of the people who will be engaging with what we build. This means taking the ideas our collaborators bring to the table (“What do you want to do with this project?”) and creating tools and interfaces that support their needs (“What do we need to build/adapt to facilitate the realization of these goals?”) while simultaneously supporting public audiences by allowing them to engage with the project content with no assumption of previously-held knowledge (“How do we need to adjust these goals—and, by extension, the supporting tools/infrastructure—to make this project inclusive of a broad, public audience?”).</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    …bridging concepts as varied as paleography and pull requests requires time and patience
</blockquote>
<p>Bill Endres writes that “building faces the challenge of not being writing.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> For Endres, “building” is a practice typically excluded from institutional decisions on tenure and promotion in humanities departments. Much of the discourse around building in DH acknowledges this disparate treatment between the creation of tools and the production of traditional research, but Endres’s phrase also reminds us that writing is the medium by and around which scholarly communication has also primarily taken place. We write, we peer review, we give written feedback. When we talk about the Things We Are Building, the role of translator or mediator is often assumed by team members who have spent time in both “worlds.” Learning how to communicate across varying disciplinary backgrounds or via unfamiliar mediums (in our case, bridging concepts as varied as paleography and pull requests) requires time and patience.</p>

<h3 id="02-a-simple-on-screen-keyboard">02. A Simple On-screen Keyboard</h3>
<p>A straightforward solution is to create an on-screen keyboard for the user. In this example, we create a Japanese keyboard with 5 characters. Clicking on each button/“keyboard key” adds the corresponding character to the end of the text input field.</p>
<p><em>Note: we’re using the Japanese hiragana characters あいうえお here because they map easily to the English characters AIUEO, and are written left to right. We’ll build up to more complex alphabets, such as Hebrew and its right-to-left layout, in later sections.</em></p>

</div>
<p>The code here is simple, but we already come across a problem: what if the user wants to add a Japanese character in the middle (instead of at the end) of the text box? This is, after all, a very basic function for a normal text box—you can place the text cursor/caret at any part of the existing text and then start typing.</p>

</div>
<p>It can help to identify shared frames of reference early in the collaboration. The original proposal for the project that would become <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> envisioned a public transcription effort that would teach volunteers “without any prerequisite knowledge” how to transcribe the Arabic and Hebrew scripts found in the Geniza. It cited a previous Zooniverse project, <a href="https://www.ancientlives.org"><em>Ancient Lives</em></a> (2011),<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> which featured a clickable keyboard that allowed users to transcribe ancient Greek papyri from the <a href="https://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/oxyrhynchus-papyri">Oxyrhynchus Collection</a> at the University of Oxford&rsquo;s Sackler Library through the process of character matching. <em>Ancient Lives</em> became an important reference for the entire Geniza project team because it allowed a group of people with a variety of professional backgrounds to engage in referential communication around a shared goal, rather than fumbling together toward an abstract concept. Starting with a critique of an existing resource allowed us to determine the features that were applicable for the context in which we were working—what we wanted to recreate (or revamp) as well as what components were missing that would be key to working with Geniza fragments.</p>
<p>To approach the transcription of a large, multilingual corpus by a nonspecialist audience, we needed to think about scaffolding. We began by considering the goals, translating those goals into actionable tasks, then breaking those tasks down to their very smallest unit. This is particularly useful from a project management perspective, where it’s necessary to get a sense of the total effort required—no matter how small the task—to see what can realistically be completed within the available time frame. Additionally, this process can help identify potential conflict in the design and development stages. There will often be overlap in the translation from goals into tasks: the goal of transcribing the Geniza corpus and the goal of making the project accessible by a public, nonspecialist audience are not separate things; indeed, each will significantly impact how the other is carried out. Breaking down the goals helps to identify the places where that overlap will create tension in the work.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Of those in our audience who could read Arabic and/or Hebrew, a significant subset would not have experience reading or transcribing Aramaic, Judeo-Persian, or any of the other languages known to be found among the Geniza fragments.
</blockquote>
<p>During the brainstorming process for <em>Scribes</em>, we discussed how the <em>Ancient Lives</em> approach (presenting users with a clickable keyboard to use while transcribing) was desirable because it provides support for audiences who don’t use an Arabic or Hebrew keyboard at home and may not be familiar with each script’s characters. We know through Google Analytics and user surveys that the majority of registered Zooniverse volunteers are from the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result, we could safely assume that a significant portion of our audience would use an English-language keyboard, and a significant subset would not be able to read Arabic and/or Hebrew. Of those in our audience who <em>could</em> read Arabic and/or Hebrew, a significant subset would not have experience reading or transcribing Aramaic, Judeo-Persian, or any of the other languages known to be found among the Geniza fragments.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> While clickable keyboards would help with the specific task of transcription within the overall project workflow, we also knew a translatable interface would be necessary to support a multilingual community of volunteers. So we decided early on that the entire project would need to be available in Arabic, English, and Hebrew, adding an additional layer of complexity to the design and development process in order to support right-to-left (RTL) as well as left-to-right (LTR) text.</p>
<div class="interlude">
<h3 id="03-text-selection">03. Text Selection</h3>
<p>This is actually a solved problem: we use the standard <code>HTMLInputElement</code>’s <code>selectionStart</code>, <code>selectionEnd</code>, and <code>setSelectionRange</code> to interact with the “text cursor” on the text input field.</p>

</div>
<p>In the example above, we’ve done two things in the code: 1. we ensure the Japanese characters are inserted at the position of the text cursor/caret, and 2. we ensure the text input maintains focus after the insertion. These may seem like minor coding considerations, but they’re important to <strong>ensure a consistent User Experience (UX), since users often have pre-set expectations on how User Interface (UI) elements should behave.</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Based on institutional knowledge—held by our Zooniverse colleagues who built the <em>Ancient Lives</em> project—and early technical experiments, we knew that a basic version of the clickable keyboard feature would be technically feasible to create. However, the breadth of scripts, languages, layouts, and physical deterioration among the vast Geniza corpus meant that there would be varying levels of difficulty in the fragments’ transcription. To be immediately presented with a random Geniza fragment and asked to transcribe it would be overwhelming for most users. To that end, we considered ways to harness existing information about the fragments (metadata) to break down the corpus into smaller groups. The problem with this approach was that the fragments came from multiple institutions, each with its own metadata system. Some of those systems were more robust (and more recently updated) than others.</p>
<p>The team agreed that this method would be helpful in creating pathways for participation for nonspecialists, but we were concerned that not all of the datasets we were working with had robust, reliable metadata. What was the taxonomy we were hoping to draw on—an existing framework for classifying fragments? A new one? How would we apply consistent metadata to so many fragments within a limited amount of time? <em>Is this something that the project volunteers could help with?</em></p>
<p>Once we determined that metadata enhancement could be its own crowdsourced task, we considered how to add that task to the project in a meaningful way.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> We wanted to make transcription accessible. But we also wondered: Could the <em>classification</em> of fragments proceed in a way that did not require previous knowledge of the materials? Would it be interesting for our audience? How would they benefit from taking part?</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Could the classification of fragments proceed in a way that did not require previous knowledge of the materials?
</blockquote>
<p>To break down the necessary metadata fields into accessible tasks, we decided to map our desired classification types onto easily identifiable visual characteristics.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The Geniza experts determined several pieces of information they might ask for at the pre-transcription stage, and were then challenged to teach the team members who weren’t familiar with the Geniza—or even manuscript studies in the broader sense—how to recognize these features when viewing a fragment. For example, in order to ask users whether a fragment was written in Hebrew script or Arabic script (or both), the content experts needed to determine what information is necessary to successfully answer the question.</p>

<h3 id="04-physical-keyboard-key-capture">04. Physical Keyboard Key Capture</h3>
<p>Alright, so we now have an on-screen keyboard. But what about the user’s physical keyboard? A user might find it easier to use their physical keyboard to do text transcription, compared to clicking each on-screen keyboard button individually. With that in mind, let’s try to translate those physical key presses into our custom character input.</p>
<p>In this example, when the user presses the &ldquo;A&rdquo; key on their keyboard, the Japanese character あ is inserted into the text field instead. Same for the other characters: A -&gt; あ , I -&gt; い, U -&gt; う, E -&gt; え, O -&gt; お</p>

<p><em>If you have an on-screen keyboard AND you&rsquo;re capturing physical key input, it’s a good idea to label those on-screen keyboard buttons with the corresponding physical keys.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest considerations here is <strong>what kind of physical keyboard does your user have?</strong> In our examples, we’re making a very hard assumption that all our users have US-International QWERTY keyboards, and we choose to map <em>physical keyboard keys</em> to their replacement characters.</p>
<p><em>Note: there are different ways to get what the user typed into a text field. keyboardEvent.code corresponds to the PHYSICAL key on the keyboard. keyboardEvent.key corresponds to the TEXT VALUE of the key. If a user presses the “A” key on a US-International QWERTY keyboard, we get code=‘KeyA,’ and key=‘a’ (if shift and caps lock are off) or key=‘A’ (if shift and caps lock are on).</em></p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Now that we know how to capture and replace keyboard input, we also need to learn when not to do so. Sometimes, when a user presses the “A” key, they just want to type in the character “A,” not “あ”! <strong>Always allow your users the option to disable your on-screen keyboard.</strong> The example above has no such option, but we&rsquo;ll explore how we can do this once we jump into the “multi-language” functionality of our onscreen keyboard.</p>

</div>
<p>This was a turning point in the collaboration, as we began to understand the real value of having multiple kinds of “strangers” and their perspectives in the room. Speaking to diverse perspectives—even within our planning meetings—prevented us from sharing ideas and information without considering how those concepts might be broken down into simpler components. Rather than being a barrier to communication, it gave us the opportunity to observe a version of the volunteer experience we were building in real time, through our interactions with one another.</p>
<h2 id="designing-scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza-for-public-access">Designing Scribes of the Cairo Geniza for Public Access</h2>
<p>As the content specialists solidified their goals and worked with our team to determine the best way to accomplish those goals, two design needs became clear: first, that we could utilize existing Zooniverse project builder infrastructures to make a pre-transcription task that would produce useful metadata; and second, that a custom transcription interface would be necessary to support the on-screen keyboards.</p>

<p>We didn’t need to start from scratch. <em>Ancient Lives</em> provided a shared reference on which to build. Which parts of that interface were successful? What made the use cases in <em>Scribes</em> unique and therefore required a rethinking of the user experience? What other transcription projects existed online that could provide inspiration for our task? These questions helped shape initial design sketches for the transcription workflow and text input area.</p>

<p>User experience (UX) design relies on common behavioral patterns to help a user feel comfortable in an interface, even when faced with a completely novel situation (such as transcribing an ancient manuscript written in an unfamiliar language). UX designers also rely heavily on direct user feedback to ensure that the interface both functions as it should and feels natural to those users. To that end, we first identified a few key groups of user personas to envision our target audience. These personas served as guides throughout the design process. Would a grad student in Massachusetts be able to quickly understand how to transcribe a line of text? Would a pensioner in Brighton? What about a modern native speaker? By keeping in mind these different experience levels, we were able to focus our design efforts and keep scope creep to a minimum.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

<li>The Japanese characters have now been compiled into a “Japanese keyboard” data object, setting the stage for <strong>dynamically generated keyboards</strong> for different languages.</li>
<li>Similarly, we now have “English keyboard” and “QWERTY layout” data objects that help ensure <strong>the visual layout of the on-screen keyboard matches the user’s physical keyboard.</strong></li>

<p>As we worked through the design, it was essential that we also speak to real users of the platform in order to validate our assumptions and test that the task we were designing was easy to understand. We reached out to our list of Zooniverse beta reviewers as well as personal networks to find native Hebrew and Arabic speakers who were willing to test the platform in translation. Through these conversations, we were able to see how a RTL interface would differ from English or other LTR language interfaces, and make adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>We also realized that because the subject matter could be intimidating, it was important to craft an interface that would straddle the line between friendly and knowledgeable. This was accomplished through the use of typography and color. First, we looked for a typeface that could be both friendly and trustworthy: both are attributes of a family of sans-serifs called Grotesque. These simple, clean typefaces are easy to read and add a friendly personality to the interface.</p>

<h3 id="06-language-selection">06. Language Selection</h3>
<p>Now that we have cleaned up the code so that the English and Japanese keyboards are stored data objects, we see that it’s very simple to add new languages/keyboards to the system, and to allow the user to switch between those languages/keyboards.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, we’ve added a joke &ldquo;Emoji keyboard&rdquo; that maps QWERTY keys to arbitrary emoji characters. Typing in “Hello world” into input text field will result in the emoji “text” of “🐟🤣🦋🦋😍 😅😍🥰🦋🐒.”</p>

<p><em>Note: there is an option to select “(No keyboard)” here, which disables the on-screen keyboard as well as key capture. As mentioned earlier, <strong>always allow your users the option to disable your on-screen keyboard.</strong></em></p>
<p>At this point, you might realize one limitation to our solution: our code simply re-maps the QWERTY keyboard, so we can only have one character for one key.</p>
<p>While we started our examples with a very simple five-character Japanese keyboard, we unfortunately have to discard it since a proper, fully functional Japanese keyboard is beyond the scope of this work. The Japanese <em>hiragana</em> writing system alone has 48 common base characters, which can be further modified with diacritics, character size, etc.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll start adding a Hebrew keyboard. The Hebrew alphabet has 22 characters, which will map very easily to English/QWERTY’s 26 characters. However, the Hebrew alphabet will introduce a new wrinkle: <strong>right-to-left text</strong>, which we’ll need to solve.</p>

</div>
<p>After the typography was chosen, we created a color palette that was inspired by the Geniza fragments themselves. A contrasting purple was chosen for the background to allow the subjects to visually pop. Even the help text was closely considered: because of the wide reach of the project, help text needed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Our baseline was a fifth-grade reading level using the Flesch-Kincaid scale.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>While most of the design used common user-interface patterns—a toolbar, iconography, other resources familiar to Zooniverse volunteers—the project goals called for the creation of a few novel or less frequently seen elements. These included the transcription mechanism itself and the interactive, on-screen keyboards.</p>
<p>In order to create useful transcription data, the team needed to ensure consistent line placement that an algorithm would be able to parse correctly.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> We looked both within and outside of Zooniverse for inspiration and found a variety of transcription methods, from single- to multi-track. We considered what to use as the basic unit of transcription: how would we ask users to break down the text on the page, e.g. by character, word, line? From our experience with other crowdsourced transcription projects, we knew that line-by-line transcription would be the optimal blend of user effort to manageable data output. And from testing, we found that it was most intuitive to click once at the start of a line and then again at the end of the line. From there, the project tutorial as well as pop-up directions guided the user through the transcription process and the use of the on-screen clickable keyboards.</p>
<div class="interlude">
<h3 id="07-hebrew-and-right-to-left-languages">07. Hebrew and Right-to-Left languages</h3>
<p>With the given assumption that English is the “default” language of web code (yes, we know, that discussion is a can of worms), it’s unsurprising that that layout of most web pages default to left-to-right (LTR), top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>As a result, we must be conscientious when we create on-screen keyboards for languages to read right-to-left (RTL), such as Hebrew and Arabic. In the example below, we’ve done two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve upgraded the keyboard data objects so each language, in addition to having characters, also has an <strong>explicit “direction” value.</strong> (Either “ltr” or “rtl”)</li>
<li>The text input field has an explicit CSS direction value that changes depending on the active keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we’re only interested in creating a functional on-screen keyboard, we only modified the CSS direction of the text input field. On the other hand, if you’re creating, for example, a whole website that supports both LTR and RTL languages, then you need to be conscientious about the layout of your entire website, and whether that layout needs to be flipped along the horizontal axis to make sense to RTL readers.</p>
<p><em>Fun(?) Note: mixing LTR text with RTL text can lead to extremely confusing UI interactions. For example, in the text input field below, using your mouse, try to highlight the word APPLE plus one character before it and one character after it, i.e. &ldquo;הAPPLEן&rdquo;. Good luck!</em></p>

<h3 id="creating-clickable-keyboards">Creating clickable keyboards</h3>
<p>With the basic functionality of the clickable keyboards in place, we wanted to consider how we might further expand this resource for the context of <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em>. To support volunteers in the paleographic elements of transcribing Geniza fragments written in Hebrew script (again, the vast majority of the corpus), Penn team member Laura Newman Eckstein created a series of twenty script-based Hebrew “Alephbets” to be used as interchangeable skins on the clickable keyboard, to complement the modern Hebrew keyboard modeled after the <em>Ancient Lives</em> approach.</p>

<p>Because of the variation in the way that individual characters are composed across the variety of hands in the Geniza, these skins are essential to helping nonexpert transcribers feel more confident submitting a transcription. Users can view alternate ways of writing a particular character, and choose the keyboard that most closely matches the script type of the fragment they’re currently transcribing. The option to return to modern characters is always available, too.</p>

Users can look at the full list of scripts available and learn how to distinguish between square, cursive, and minuscule scripts. They can learn the names of Hebrew characters. Regional variations on scripts may inspire transcribers to think more closely about how or why writing might differ across physical space.

<p>Now that we’ve proven that it’s possible to map different key input to characters from different languages, we need to solve another problem.

<p>The actual hard work comes in two parts. First, it requires a human hand to create the reference image JPEG for each style of script, and to ensure it has a consistent layout. Second, there&rsquo;s a one-off upfront development cost to map the visuals to the data. We found that this early investment is well worth it when we get into the next section.</p>
<p><em>For our project, we decided to put every character of the “Yemenite Square” Hebrew script into a single image file (i.e. as opposed to having dozens of image files, one for each character) and used a CSS technique called “image sprites” to separate each character when needed. For example, when we want to show the ‘Alef’ א character (top row, right-most column) we tell the code to “crop” the image at x=440px y=0px width=50px height=50px.</em></p>

<h2 id="research-development-and-volunteer-advocacy">Research Development and Volunteer Advocacy</h2>
<p>The process of designing and building <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> required a deeply human-centered approach to ensure we could meet the original project goals of transcribing the Geniza corpus and providing a space for anyone to engage with Geniza materials, no matter their level of expertise. To achieve this, we considered the range of experience our users might have, and included scaffolding in the project to ensure that there were multiple pathways to participation (e.g. the Sorting workflow, transcription with aid from on-screen keyboards).</p>
<p>In this essay, we’ve discussed the interpersonal challenges of collaborating across disciplines, and the technical challenges of designing and building resources for a range of users. The final piece to discuss is the challenge of balancing engagement and outcome—in particular, identifying where the opportunities exist in this process to advocate for a positive user experience from our positions of power as builders and project leads, and considering what sort of impact that advocacy can have on the project’s outcomes.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Crowdsourcing is never a case of building a project and letting volunteers come to you. Scribes has succeeded in attracting a broad volunteer base because we built the project intentionally, with them in mind.
</blockquote>
<p>Whether we’re discussing workflows, networks of communication, data pipelines, or design processes, the individual components of public crowdsourcing projects cannot exist independently from the project as a whole. We don’t think about design as separate from data, because these pieces are inextricably linked; project data influences design, which then impacts data output. Every decision we make during the design phase will impact various other pieces of a project beyond those directly affected in that moment. Choosing to build for a broad audience instead of restricting the project to those with previous experience will have an impact on the results. It will also increase the amount of labor involved in creating the project.</p>

<p><em>Below, you can see three different Hebrew scripts that we used. You’ll note that while we made an effort to keep the visual layout, character position, and character size consistent across every style of script, some scripts are missing certain characters. For example, both Maghrebi Cursive and Byzantine Miniscule don’t have a visual reference for the “elongated Kaf” ך character. In these cases, we simply didn’t have a visual reference from the source.</em></p>

<p>In the case of <em>Scribes</em>, creating the Sorting workflow was not part of the original project goals. Including the workflow meant that there would be another large set of project results, in addition to the transcription data being generated, that the Penn team would need to manage. It also meant that our team would have to consider how best to move data from the Sorting workflow into the appropriate Transcription workflows based on how the data was classified. Yes, this choice has resulted in more work for all of us, but it is also by far the most popular workflow on the project, with more than 325,000 classifications generated since <em>Scribes</em> launched in August 2017.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    An early review of the Sorting workflow data showed that for a majority of the fragments, volunteers were in one hundred percent agreement about which category best represented the scripts being used in the fragment (Hebrew, Arabic, both, no text).
</blockquote>
<p>The Sorting workflow and the clickable keyboards are both examples of how creating projects that are truly catered to nonspecialists requires teams to actually include public engagement as a goal and priority, instead of allowing it to be a secondary outcome to data generation. This prioritization requires serious time and effort. In particular, it requires a rejection of the common narrative around crowdsourcing as being a way to save time and energy, or a good option for under-resourced institutions who don’t have staff time to process data. Crowdsourcing is never a case of building a project and letting volunteers come to you. <em>Scribes</em> has succeeded in attracting a broad volunteer base because we built the project intentionally, with them in mind.</p>
<p>Paleography and manuscript transcription have traditionally been the purview of specialists, only accessible to those with institutional access and the skills to be trusted with fragile physical resources. By opening up a complex task to a broad, nonspecialist audience through collaborative, human-centered design, <em>Scribes</em> says to the public, “We trust you, we appreciate your help, and we worked hard to create a space that will support you.” We ended up with a space that “strangers” to the field could explore without feeling lost.</p>
<p>And it worked. An early review of the Sorting workflow data showed that for a majority of the fragments, volunteers were in one hundred percent agreement about which category best represented the scripts being used in the fragment (Hebrew, Arabic, both, no text). As Penn team member Emily Esten notes in a blog post about these results, “That’s impressive, considering the range of expertise from our volunteer base. For volunteers who had no experience at all, this means your best guess contributed to the community of knowledge and was, more likely than not, in agreement with others.”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> For public crowdsourcing projects, this is the best possible outcome: useful results created by a community of volunteers who don’t feel like they need special credentials to take part, and who can then see their collective effort taking shape as a meaningful contribution to research. From “strangers in a landscape” to makers themselves.</p>

<h2 id="douglass-days-annual-celebrations-before-the-pandemic">Douglass Day’s annual celebrations before the pandemic</h2>
<p>In 2017 we began to hold an event celebrating Frederick Douglass’s chosen birthday of February 14. Our event invites people to help transcribe digitized collections of African American history and culture, and to host transcribe-a-thon parties with their friends, classmates, or colleagues. Thousands have participated over the years.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Each year, we listen to the melodies of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and eat birthday cake. Our livestreamed broadcast and social media posts go out to thousands. We share photos on Twitter and Instagram of libraries, community centers, and churches where people transcribe shoulder to shoulder. At our local events, we enjoy seeing strangers chat about what they found or learned. Our events expand who gets to help preserve and commemorate Black history.</p>
<p>We started this event from scratch in 2017. By the time we held our events at Howard University in 2020, we felt like we’d attained some momentum with our team members at the University of Delaware, Princeton’s Center for Digital Humanities, and the Center for Black Digital Research at Pennsylvania State University.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="adjusting-during-the-covid-19-pandemic">Adjusting During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
<p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. We had lessons for building community from years past. Yet even though we had been livestreaming and tweeting since 2017, we had few models for building a virtual, distanced community. We spent months of difficult planning to adapt our previous model into a virtual format.</p>
<p>Crucially, we connected with Lauren Algee and Carlyn Osborn at <em><a href="https://crowd.loc.gov/">By the People</a></em>—a Library of Congress project—to feature their campaign transcribing the papers of Mary Church Terrell, a groundbreaking Black feminist educator, activist, intellectual, and writer.</p>
<p>In the end, we managed to hold an event in February 2021 that retained the best parts of our past celebrations through lots of perseverance and creativity.</p>
<p>This snippet serves as a reflection on that transition. We’re sharing our hard-won lessons to help any others who might face similar challenges while hosting virtual and accessible events that foster ethical communities.</p>
<h2 id="redefining-our-digital-connections">Redefining our (digital) connections</h2>
<p>One of our principles is to create communal spaces that engage Black communities in remembering Black history.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> As we struggled with the constraints of pandemic isolation, we saw opportunity in our collective digital shifts. Could we use this opportunity to reimagine how we connect with our diverse audiences, spread the word about our events, and adapt our previous community engagements?</p>
<p>This process of rethinking our outreach transformed our use of online communications (social media, newsletter, and tutorial videos). We found new ways to connect with our audiences using tools in novel ways.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-outreach">Transforming Outreach</h2>
<p>Launching our social media campaign early on helped attract attention to the event and prepare our audiences for the redesigned event. We also created new hashtags, such as our <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GreatDouglassDayBakeoff&amp;src=typed_query">#GreatDouglassDayBakeoff</a>.</p>

<h2 id="our-results">Our Results</h2>
<p>Making Douglass Day more accessible resulted in our largest Douglass Day audience ever. We had over 7,000 attendees, including K–12 teachers, students, professors, librarians, local organizers, graduate students, community groups, historic Black sororities, civic groups, and individual participants. It would not have been possible if we had not integrated the needs of our communities into our process of creating a virtual community. We will take these lessons to our future celebrations to expand the hybrid possibilities for developing our communities around these digital projects.

<p>Online crowdsourcing—a series of methods for engaging volunteers with STEM, humanities, and cultural heritage research—has rapidly matured between 2000 and 2021. These efforts have been led by research groups and platform designers like <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a>, platform designers like <a href="https://fromthepage.com/">FromThePage</a>, <a href="https://omeka.org/">Omeka</a>, <a href="https://pybossa.com/">PYBOSSA </a>and <a href="https://scripto.org/">Scripto</a>, and cultural heritage institutions like the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA) and <a href="https://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian Institution</a>. Volunteers help researchers, journalists, conservationists, cultural heritage practitioners, and one another to gather data that contributes to real research, original art, policy, community health, and more. In this essay, we will focus on cultural heritage crowdsourcing, and transcription projects in particular. Typically, these projects invite volunteers to transcribe handwritten or printed materials produced with ornate type or typewriter documents that—due to slight irregularities of the type, faint ink, or use of thin papers like onion skin—are not amenable to handwritten text recognition (HTR) or optical character recognition (OCR).</p>

</div></p>
<p>Crowdsourced transcription projects generally fall into one of two categories: those that are structured around a particular research problem or question, and those that gather data to enhance search and discovery of materials for open-ended and ongoing purposes. Whereas many researchers want to extract particular pieces of information from datasets, such as water salinity and temperature from old ships logs to feed data into climate change models (<a href="https://www.oldweather.org/"><em>Old Weather</em></a>), most cultural heritage crowdsourcing projects gather transcriptions of entire documents to support as-yet-unstipulated research purposes. Their goal is to create pathways for discovery in one or more content management systems (CMS), the catalogs and/or other platforms that make metadata and images of original materials discoverable.</p>
<p>Transcriptions that reproduce the text on the page (as opposed to select pieces of data) have a variety of applications across numerous disciplines, and also have the power to solve two common challenges for researchers and the librarians and archivists who support them: 1) transcriptions speed up discovery, and 2) transcriptions can (if presented properly online) increase accessibility for those who cannot read the original handwriting, including those who are Blind or cognitively impaired and use a screen reader. Before we delve into a few case studies of organizations that have used crowdsourcing methods to generate text transcriptions for these purposes, we want to emphasize that while researchers and archivists alike want to foster discovery and accessibility, the barriers to achieving these goals through crowdsourcing are complex and not yet widely discussed.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    it’s not right to invite people to help researchers and increase accessibility … if the resulting data aren’t made widely available
</blockquote>
<p>The number of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) institutions that have successfully integrated their crowdsourced transcription data into their core CMSs is far outweighed by those that have not yet found a workable solution, and many who have found solutions have used workarounds that are a stop-gap until better alternatives emerge. For example, a common workaround is to publish bulk data in an online repository on GitHub or a university library or research repository, while GLAM practitioners try to determine how to integrate data into their core CMS. Lucinda Blaser of Royal Museums Greenwich identified the absence of appropriate metadata fields in her institution’s CMS as a major barrier to integrating the <em>Old Weather</em> transcriptions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> She and her colleagues were eager to use the data, but the metadata field they hoped to use had a character limit set by the vendor. Anne Bowser et al. expose the absence of norms and ongoing funding for data integration across citizen science crowdsourcing domains more broadly (including transcription projects), and highlight the ethical problems of not releasing crowdsourced data. They aver, and we agree, that it’s not right to invite people to “help researchers,” “increase accessibility,” and achieve other goals if the resulting data aren’t made widely available, as well as understandable—meaning that the methods of collection are well described.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Ina-Maria Jansson and Chern Li Liew explore anxieties about crowdsourcing data quality among GLAM practitioners as well as members of the public, some of whom are anxious about whether crowdsourced data deserves a place in the authoritative record.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Jansson and Liew’s findings are particularly disturbing, because they reveal that many institutions are actively engaged in crowdsourcing but still deeply uncomfortable with their own stated aims. These institutions are thus unlikely to hold up their end of the bargain with volunteers—namely making the data that volunteers produce available for research and enabling access. More work is needed to address concerns about data quality. Current approaches include:</p>
<ol>
<li>overcoming barriers to data publication and integration when people can see examples from peer institutions or trusted sources, they are likely to be reassured;</li>
<li>data quality analysis studies that provide solid information about the transcription outcomes from different projects, and</li>
<li>real talk about the quality of other data that is already in the authoritative record. For example, Victoria Van Hyning and her teammates at the Library of Congress (LOC) frequently pointed out to colleagues that the Library already publishes low-quality OCR in the authoritative record (often provided by vendors as part of their digitization package), and that crowdsourced transcriptions are typically of a much higher quality than this OCR.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we can all more openly discuss and address these challenges and ways of meeting them, we will make better progress in supporting collections discovery and use, research, and novel applications of crowdsourced data.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    data management planning is a necessary part of crowdsourcing
</blockquote>
<p>Crowdsourcing platform designers Ben and Sara Brumfield are also drawing attention to these issues as they affect scholarly editors and cultural heritage practitioners, and are working on some new solutions to data unification, publication, and discovery. In a recorded talk to the International Interoperable Image Framework (IIIF) conference in 2021, they demonstrate how content from digital scholarly editions can move between multiple systems like Fedora or ContentDM to FromThePage, where the images are transcribed by volunteers and/or an editorial team, and then back to a scholarly editing platform such as Omeka-S, all with the help of IIIF-compliant metadata and images. They discuss how scholarly edition materials might then feed back into the original CMS via the same IIIF metadata, in order to enhance the materials and increase discovery on the host institution’s CMS. They conclude their piece by announcing work on a new feature that will “allow editors to export stand-alone web-pages for minimal computing needs and digital preservation” in cases where there isn’t an institutional CMS amenable to this kind of roundtripping of the data.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h3>
<p>The remainder of this essay offers three case studies of projects that showcase different successes and challenges in crowdsourced transcription data integration. Our early-stage research reveals that the challenges facing these projects are more widely shared by a range of crowdsourcing stakeholders, including platform designers, academics, cultural heritage practitioners and the vendors who create CMSs for cultural heritage organizations. Van Hyning was directly involved in each project. These case studies include <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/shakespeares-world"><em>Shakespeare’s World</em></a> (SW), which launched on the Zooniverse platform in 2015 and was sunset in 2019. It was a partnership between Zooniverse, the Folger Shakespeare Library and the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED). The <a href="https://crowd.loc.gov/"><em>By the People</em></a> project (BTP) was launched by the Library of Congress (LOC) on a bespoke platform called <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia">Concordia</a> in 2018, and the <em>David C. Driskell Papers Project</em> was created by Van Hyning, six MLIS students, and their colleagues at the <a href="https://driskellcenter.umd.edu/">David C. Driskell Center</a> at the University of Maryland on the FromThePage platform in 2020, and launched in 2021. All of these were produced by multidisciplinary teams involving cultural heritage practitioners such as archivists, metadata specialists, curators, and academics from STEM and/or humanities backgrounds. Some projects involved students, while others involved formal project managers, web developers and database engineers (system designers). The projects were built on three different crowdsourcing platforms, all of which are separate “pass-through” applications that are not directly connected to the relevant cultural heritage institution’s CMS. The datasets in each case require some dedicated effort to move the content out of the crowdsourcing platform and into the CMS to appear alongside the digital images of the original documents, and thus make them searchable down to the page level.</p>

<p>In this case study we’ll outline some successes of <em>SW</em> before coming on to the challenges of data aggregation that arose on the Zooniverse side, and the data integration challenges that arose on the Folger side. The quality of the research and engagement outcomes are significant, and bring home the ways in which the <em>SW</em> team’s struggles with data wrangling curtailed our overall rate of discovery. However, the data challenges the team encountered, and the enormous efforts that collaborators have spent to address these (including major updates to the Zooniverse platform and the development of numerous codebases and processes to clean the data) are important research activities and outcomes in their own right.</p>
<p>The goals of <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> (<em>SW</em>) were to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage a broad volunteer base to transcribe digitized Folger manuscripts from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to make the manuscript contents amenable to full-text search;</li>
<li>Engage early modern literature and history scholars, especially those with strengths in women’s history, history of science, food, and medicine, with crowdsourcing as a means to help them identify new materials for their research;</li>
<li>Identify previously unrecorded words, variants, and older usages of words for the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>), and</li>
<li>Try out new approaches to transcription on the Zooniverse platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project achieved these goals to varying degrees. It exceeded our expectations in terms of engagement, particularly regarding how volunteers engaged with researchers and the <em>OED</em> team. Thousands of volunteers transcribed, discussed, and conducted research about early modern manuscripts, history, language, and culture, thereby gaining or enhancing research and paleographical skills they might not otherwise have had the opportunity to develop. Together with volunteers, the team helped advance the research agendas of six scholars, resulting in a half dozen publications that cite the contributions of volunteers. The team also encountered unexpected challenges relating to the data outputs of the project, which in turn led to new avenues of research at Zooniverse from 2016 to the time of writing, as well as a long-running effort to make the <em>SW</em> data usable.</p>

<p><em>Shakespeare’s World</em> attracted 3,926 registered volunteers, as well as anonymous participants (numbers unknown), who transcribed 11,490 digital images of manuscript pages (single and double page spreads) over a period of nearly four years (2015-2019). These included letters, recipes, and newsletters, an early form of manuscript newspaper delivery service that was curated for particular recipients.</p>

<p>Volunteers identified several words that were not previously included in the <em>OED</em>, as well as a ninety-year antedating of “partner” in the sense of spouse or lover, and a nearly two-hundred-year antedating of “white lie.” The <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> Talk board (a discussion forum for the project) was a vital space for what guest researcher Lisa Smith described as a form of collective close reading (close reading is a widely used form of literary analysis typically conducted by solo researchers).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> To take just one example of collective close reading and research from <em>SW</em> Talk, the team present the case of “taffytie tartes.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This phrase was identified by volunteer @kodemunkey just eight days into the project. Lively discussion as to its exact meaning blossomed on Talk, as volunteers, early modern recipe researchers including Smith, Folger and Zooniverse staff, as well as <em>OED</em> Deputy Editor Philip Durkin shared evidence from the <em>OED</em>, other <em>SW</em> recipes, and their own research.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Durkin described our community process in a blog post, offering etymological starting points for the meaning of Taffytie (linking it to taffeta fabric), and a reflection on the value of our endeavor. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sources featured in Shakespeare’s World are particularly interesting and valuable for OED lexicographers. We have relatively easy access to a good deal of printed material from this period, now increasingly searchable in electronic collections. It is much harder for OED’s lexicographers to survey patterns of use in manuscript sources from this period, which often differ in interesting ways from printed sources—this can be in small features like spelling (as for instance taffytie), as well as in reflecting aspects of life (such as culinary recipes) that are relatively under-represented in the printed sources, or only appear there in a rather different light. This project therefore offers a new way in to some material that has previously been underexploited in tracing the history of English.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order for “taffytie tartes” to be included in the <em>OED</em> the editorial team needed additional evidence, and in particular dated evidence, which can be harder to derive from manuscript sources like recipe books that created for everyday practical use in family homes for ongoing use. Volunteers kept up their search on <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> and a few years later Van Hyning expanded the hunt for additional sources by reaching out to Mary-Anne Boermans, a finalist on the <em>Great British Bake Off</em> Season 2. Van Hyning was intrigued by Boermans’s historically informed baking practice, and had a hunch that Boermans might have come across taffety tartes in her research, and whether she’d be interested in the recipes from Folger.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Boermans <em>had</em> come across several recipes and had already included one in her first cookbook <em>Great British Bakes: Forgotten Treasures for Modern Bakers</em> (2013), but, as she wrote in a blog post for the Folger in 2019, many of the recipes she’d found were missing crucial information as to what made a Taffety Tart a Taffety Tart. The presence of thirteen recipes at the Wellcome confirmed that taffety tarts “were very much a ‘thing’ in seventeenth-century food fashion. Trying to define what exactly this ‘thing’ was, however, was more complicated than I first imagined.” The Folger examples provide crucial missing evidence about the fillings, pastry type, shape, bake time, temperature and decorative features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is almost a ‘complete package’ in terms of the details supplied, needing only to have been dated and include a drawing of the pastry shape in order to complete the picture. It might not be the jigsaw box cover image, but it’s definitely the four corner pieces of the puzzle, because it reveals that what this Jacobean pastry most resembles, with its thin, rectangular shape, fruit filling and icing is… a pop-tart. A seventeenth-century pop-tart.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boermans kindly baked four different examples and shared images of her work:</p>

<h3 id="shakespeares-world-data-cleaning-and-release"><em>Shakespeare’s World</em> Data Cleaning and Release</h3>
<p><em>SW</em> was always meant to be fun and inclusive: a place where people could learn about subjects and people they might never have considered. The <em>SW</em> team very consciously emphasized that volunteers could take part in—and even lead—discovery and research impact through the <em>OED</em> partnership, and also tried to make the transcription task itself as accessible to beginners as possible. The team hypothesized that by letting people choose to transcribe as little as a word or line they would only contribute what they felt confident reading, and that, in keeping with the broader Zooniverse methods of promoting nonspecialist engagement and multiple independent classifications followed by aggregation, the project would make crowdsourced transcription accessible and welcoming in new ways. This proved true, based on the feedback via Talk and other venues, but unfortunately the complexities of transcription—the slight differences of interpretation from one user to another, stemming from genuine ambiguities present in most documents rather than user mistakes—combined with the imprecision of clustering closely written lines of text, rendered much of the output data very difficult to use.</p>
<p>Each word on each page was independently transcribed by three or more people, and their transcriptions were compared and combined using a clustering algorithm and a genetic sequencing algorithm.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Our early aggregation testing was based on gold standard data produced by project staff at Folger, against which they compared transcriptions produced by Zooniverse staff, who included an early modernist with paleography expertise (Van Hyning) as well as folks without paleography training, including astronomers and developers, many of whom hold higher degrees in other fields including philosophy, ecology, and computer science. The project team also gathered transcription data from the pool of Zooniverse beta tester volunteers, a subset of the wider Zooniverse user community who test projects under development. Early aggregation results were promising, showing approximately 98 percent agreement between transcribers in many cases. But as the project went public and the heterogeneity of both the participants and the documents increased, clustering accuracy dipped, which negatively impacted text string comparison. In retrospect, it’s clear that our beta testing sample was too skewed towards people with higher degrees, relevant subject knowledge, and/or existing familiarity with the Zooniverse platform.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">

</blockquote>
<p>From 2016 to 2018, the team made several attempts to improve aggregation for <em>SW</em> and the numerous transcription projects that also used similar methods of transcription (i.e. <em>AnnoTate</em> with Tate Britain, and <em>Decoding the Civil War</em> with the Huntington). The project had some success, but the overall results still require significant editing. For three years this was done by grant-funded staff at Folger. In 2021, <em>SW</em> Co-Investigators Heather Wolfe and Van Hyning worked with colleagues at Folger and the University of Maryland iSchool’s iConsultancy undergraduate capstone students on a <em>SW</em> data cleaning project.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The students used the most recent iteration of aggregated data provided by Zooniverse, and focused on stripping out duplicate lines of text, which was one of the most common errors introduced by aggregation (this is based on visual inspection by former Folger palaeographer Sarah Powell, and <em>SW</em> Co-Is Wolfe and Van Hyning, rather than a full formal analysis of the data. Further quantitative analysis of different stages of <em>SW</em> data is planned for the future).</p>
<p>This level of intervention certainly allays any anxieties about quality control, and can be seen as the gold standard for cultural heritage practitioners wishing to present accurate and highly authoritative information to their patrons. However, this level of transformation and encoding is prohibitively labor intensive even without unexpected data-cleaning challenges. For this reason, since February 2019, Folger has started making plain text transcriptions available on their main discovery platform, a lightly customized off-the-shelf instance of Luna (<a href="luna.folger.edu">luna.folger.edu</a>). According to Folger metadata librarian Emily Whal, they added a transcription “‘Facet Search’ button on the collection home page [that] take[s] you to a list of the call numbers available in the collection.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  On Luna, <em>SW</em> transcriptions join approximately 19,000 transcriptions produced on Folger’s in-house transcription system called Dromio, which was developed over fifteen years ago by Folger developer Mike Poston for Wolfe’s palaeography classes. Dromio continues to support pedagogy, as well as transcribathon events. As of October 2021, 7,271 <em>SW</em> transcriptions have been edited into these three presentations, encoded with TEI P-4 markup and published for search and download on the <em>Early Modern Manuscripts Online</em> (EMMO) platform (emmo.folger.edu). <a href="https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/FOLGER~3~3">Over 12,500 transcriptions have been incorporated into Luna</a>.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> To get to Luna, <em>SW</em> transcriptions that have been tidied up by the UMD students, but that haven’t gone through the <em>EMMO</em> treatment, are uploaded to the <a href="https://fromthepage.com/folger">FromThePage crowdsourcing platform</a> and edited by Folger docents, volunteers, and staff. In other words, the crowdsourced data are going through a further phase of crowdsourced editing. The <em>SW</em> transcriptions in Luna are not the same documents (yet) as those in <em>EMMO</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Both the successes and the challenges of Zooniverse transcription approaches on <em>SW</em> and its sister project <em>AnnoTate</em> led to important developments for the platform. The first was a successful grant bid to the IMLS in 2016 to develop new approaches to text transcription, explicitly to test whether collaborative or independent methods were more accurate. This supported the development of <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> and <em>Anti-Slavery Manuscripts</em>, and subsequent publications about data quality and volunteer engagement in independent versus collaborative methods of transcription.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Additional grant-funded work led by Samantha Blickhan resulted in a new text aggregation editing tool called <a href="https://alice.zooniverse.org/">ALI/CE</a>.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-people"><em>By the People</em></h2>
<p>Our next case study is the Library of Congress (LOC) <em>By the People</em> (<em>BTP</em>) crowdsourced transcription project. <em>BTP</em> features materials from across the LOC’s Special Collections divisions (Manuscript, Rare Book, Folklife, and others). These are arranged into “Campaigns” and presented to volunteers along with transcription conventions, a discussion platform, and explanatory material to help folks learn a bit about the subjects of the documents. These range from the papers of Rosa Parks, to those of presidents Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. Despite the heterogeneity of the documents that pass through the platform, and indeed the heterogeneity of metadata models within the LOC, the data outputs from the project are fairly easy to work with, and the rate of data publication has been fairly fast. <em>BTP</em> relies on volunteers being able to peer-review one another’s transcriptions. Pages can be transcribed and edited by multiple volunteers before being marked as “complete.” This review system enables collaboration between transcribers, and between transcribers and the LOC staff who support <em>BTP</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the foresight and advocacy of various stakeholders at the LOC, the project was well staffed and resourced from the outset and included provision for full-time community managers, a team of developers, user experience specialists, metadata specialists, and accessibility experts. The project&rsquo;s transition from a “pilot” effort funded through gift money, to “core infrastructure” funded through congressional appropriations, more than a year ahead of schedule, has been cited by Ben Brumfield of FromThePage as evidence for the “maturity of the [crowdsourcing transcription] methodology.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Although the project was built on a separate transcription platform, the expectation from the start was that the data should return to loc.gov
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the success of <em>BTP</em> stems from LOC staff’s ability to publish the transcriptions. Although the project was built on a separate transcription platform, the expectation from the start was that the data should return to loc.gov (the Library’s main web property and discovery system) early and often. Our first data round-trip occurred less than three months after launch, and consisted of 781 pages from across the five original campaigns.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> The <em>BTP</em> team and stakeholders worked together to identify a data pathway, including relevant metadata fields, on-screen presentation, appropriate language to describe and acknowledge volunteer efforts, and important internal questions about custodial responsibility for the data over time. The project team went into this process aware of the challenges, but also aware of possible workarounds and solutions. The incorporation of OCR into loc.gov was a helpful precedent, as was the fact loc.gov is a bespoke system maintained by a team of internal engineers and developers.</p>
<p>Though glad of this early success, the team quickly learned from users who consulted manuscripts online that it was confusing when some pages in a letter or journal were transcribed and others were not. The team thought it was best to publish any data when it became available, but user feedback revealed it was best to wait until full documents are done. So the team changed their approach from March 2019 onward, waiting until entire Campaigns of documents (i.e. the Branch Rickey papers or Rosa Parks’s papers) are completed, before the results are ingested into loc.gov.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Of the over 620,000 documents made available on <em>BTP</em> since October 2018, roughly 392,000 pages have been transcribed, reviewed, and marked as complete by volunteers, and 63,400 have been incorporated into loc.gov. The data are published in two ways. First, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?in=&amp;q=%22volunteers+participating+in+the+By%22&amp;new=true">the transcriptions</a> are embedded in the metadata for individual pages as well as full documents. They appear alongside the images of the original manuscripts, thus creating pathways to individual pages. These transcriptions can be downloaded as .txt files either one page at a time or as whole documents. An attribution to the volunteers appears in two places, first as an overlay in the on-screen display for each page, and embedded in the .txt transcription file itself: “Transcribed and reviewed by volunteers participating in the <em>By The People</em> project at crowd.loc.gov.” The second way that LOC makes the transcriptions available is as <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=contributor:by+the+people+(program)">bulk datasets</a> consisting of a .CSV file and README file detailing the context in which the data were originally collected on <em>BTP</em>.

Driskell Center</a> (DCDC) is an art gallery, archive, and educational center founded with the central mission of celebrating Black artists and art history. It was founded by colleagues of Driskell after his retirement, as a mark of respect and admiration for his incredible contributions to art history, education, and artistic production. Driskell was an American artist and educator who was instrumental in establishing Black art as a scholarly field of study: he generated a significant correspondence with leading artists including Alan Porter and Georgia O’Keefe, as well as his students and mentees.</p>
<p>Professor Driskell died due to complications of Covid-19 on April 1, 2020. In order to celebrate and remember this fixture of both the University of Maryland and of the art community, Van Hyning collaborated with colleagues at the Driskell Center, and six MLIS students to create a crowdsourcing project on the From the Page platform featuring his archives, such as letters and journals. <a href="https://fromthepage.com/umdtranscription/david-c-driskell-papers"><em>The David C. Driskell Papers Project</em></a> (<em>DCDPP</em>) is hosted within the Driskell Center as an online crowdsourced transcription project hosted in the FromThePage platform. The transcription project exists alongside an exhibit of Driskell’s papers also hosted by the DCDC. While not immediately related, both the transcription project and the exhibition existed to celebrate the life of Driskell and invite the public to share in the memory of his life and legacy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The transcription project focuses predominantly on the written documents contained within the curated collection of personal papers. The team endeavored to make Driskell’s personal papers and the accompanying transcriptions easily accessible to best serve both an informational role and an accessibility role for researchers attempting to learn more about his life and the impact of his efforts to raise awareness of the quality, quantity, and vibrancy of Black art in America and abroad. The project launched in February 2021 with a corpus of over 1,200 documents, and additional materials have been uploaded since. Volunteers and some of the original project team have transcribed over 1,300 pages of documents and staff have begun work on indexing these transcriptions following review and OCR corrections.</p>

<p>But for all the ease of using FTP to produce usable transcription data for the digitized objects in the collection, there were known issues from the outset when it came to the storage and presentation of the transcription data on the DCDC’s existing CMS. The DCDC employs PastPerfect, a CMS that is typically used by museums and galleries to catalog and describe physical objects rather than archives. This software is designed with the stated intent to be used in all manner of cultural heritage institutions, not just galleries or museums. PastPerfect’s own website says that “over 11,000 museums, historical societies, archives, libraries, and other collecting institutions worldwide have purchased PastPerfect Museum Software since its first release in 1998”; however, the fundamental structure of PastPerfect is not ideal for archival metadata structures and arrangement.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> The system assumes that each record pertains to one physical item such as a painting or sculpture, for which a few photos will suffice, but an archival item might consist of hundreds of pages, and there might be numerous items in a given folder or box which are not described at the item much less the page level. The record structure isn’t granular enough. Furthermore, other than a notes field, there is no space within the PastPerfect CMS to represent transcription data. To use a notes field in this system, the DCDC archivist would have to manually upload each transcription, which is too labor intensive for this organization.</p>
<p>The project team knew about these issues prior to creating the <em>DCDPP</em> crowdsourced transcription project, as they are common in the GLAM community. Even highly specialized repositories tend to have a mixture of formats that most CMSs don’t quite cater to. The Zooniverse project <a href="https://anno.tate.org.uk/#/"><em>AnnoTate</em></a> (2015–2019), with Tate Archive, was designed to produce transcription data for a <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/archive/collections">bespoke CMS</a> that unites object and archival records. They embarked on <em>DCDPP</em> in part to gain insights and data for our ongoing conversations about how best to serve the heterogeneous materials housed at the DCDC. Crowdsourcing projects, especially smaller scale pilot projects, can empower cultural heritage institutions to experiment with incorporating more diverse and nontraditional data into their CMSs, and hopefully also give them the data they need to advocate for their needs to vendors who supply those systems. While the larger questions of CMS type unfold, the team can publish the Driskell data in a number of venues, including the DCDC’s main website or the <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/dbfinder/id/UMD05542">Digital Repository of the University of Maryland</a> (DRUM).</p>
<h2 id="integrating-solutions-for-transcription-data">Integrating Solutions for Transcription Data</h2>
<p>Regardless of how crowdsourced data are managed and made available, data management planning is a necessary part of crowdsourcing, and conversations about how to achieve data publication or integration should start as early as possible. Solving these questions ahead of launch, and preparing for potential content management issues, can ensure that projects meet the institutional or individual’s vision more effectively. If you’re a GLAM practitioner using an off-the-shelf CMS, talk to your vendor. Find out if your license or product level includes a capacious enough field for transcriptions. Find out whether you can import content in bulk or whether you have to cut and paste transcriptions one at a time. Be up front with your volunteers about your ambitions for the data, as well as current limitations.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Archives typically arrange and describe materials at the level of items (the journal, the letter) or boxes (a collection of folders with letters from various correspondents) rather than pages, whereas transcriptions bring us right down to the page level.
</blockquote>
<p>As institutions such as the Folger have begun ingesting their data, we’ve learned more about the widespread challenges of ingesting long runs of text into CMSs—no matter how clean the data from crowdsourcing platforms are—whether these are off-the-shelf products or bespoke systems created by institutions. Sometimes metadata managers can shoehorn transcriptions into a field without a character count limit, but the status of the transcriptions within archival description is uncertain and still emerging. Archives typically arrange and describe materials at the level of items (the journal, the letter) or boxes (a collection of folders with letters from various correspondents) rather than pages, whereas transcriptions bring us right down to the page level. The technical fixes may be relatively simple, but there’s a much more significant shift that needs to happen at the level of archival practice and cultural norms.</p>
<p>Data publication can take a wide variety of forms in order to meet the varying demands for different projects and the visions of different institutions hosting a crowdsourced transcription project. There may not be a one-size-fits-all solution, especially when we consider that most institutions have quirky ways of describing rare materials in the first place—quirks that are shaped by the materials themselves, the many layers of metadata that accrue to objects over time, and the affordances and limitations of different CMSs. Whatever the quirks, though, crowdsourced data deserves a place in the authoritative record. Data can be posted in bulk as .CSV files on institutional webpages, GitHub, Internet Archive or other repositories, and/or in metadata fields that connect the transcription directly to the image in question. Data should also, ideally, be publicized and described in articles and blog posts where they may reach a wide range of potential users—the <a href="https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/"><em>Journal of Open Humanities Data</em></a> is one such venue (Van Hyning serves on the editorial board of the Journal, Jones as a copyeditor). Collaborators on the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> project do a blend of several of these approaches for the <a href="https://genizalab.princeton.edu/resources/datasets"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> data</a>. A stopgap to these solutions would be a simple note in a metadata field, a finding aid, and/or on an institution’s website saying that transcription data for a given page, document, or collection can be made available upon request. This would enable institutions to better meet the needs of Blind users or others who use screen reader technologies to access web-based written content. This would be a move towards 508 compliance, specifically making projects and their outputs more accessible to people who use screen readers.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> If organizations doing crowdsourced transcription have concrete plans for data storage and accessibility at the outset of the project, they will be in a stronger position to achieve Web Content Accessibility Guide (WCAG 2.0 or 2.1) compliance in the transcription data display.</p>

Steffy Reader, a retired psychotherapist, has contributed to the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> and a number of other Zooniverse projects since 2018. In the clip below, they meet for the first time during the conference <em>Crowdsourcing and the Humanities</em> and discover that they had already been collaborating anonymously via the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> site. What follows is a dialogue between them about this moment and the results of their serendipitous collaboration in analyzing communal register fragments from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew:</strong> In this piece Steffy and I continue the conversation from our April 2021 panel in order to explain the basis of our collaboration, the processes by which we analyze Geniza texts and, most importantly, the stakes of crowdsourcing projects for historical research. Steffy’s work in compiling collections of Geniza fragments with similar formatting, scribal hands, and ink stamps alerted me to the existence of document types that could have otherwise taken months or years to locate. Her individual contributions speak volumes for the ways in which a vast network of <em>Scribes</em> contributors has accelerated the accessibility of Geniza texts. Contributors like Steffy are tackling foundational questions in the field of Cairo Geniza Studies that have never been pursued on such a mass scale. From the moment I happened upon the <em>Scribes</em> discussion boards in the summer of 2020, I was struck by the abundance of user collections and comments regarding the distinctions between genres of literary and documentary fragments.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Steffy, in your volunteer work and collections, what are the core features within the layout of texts that you focus on in order to distinguish between fragment types?</p>
<p><strong>Steffy:</strong> Since I can’t read Arabic or Hebrew, I take skilled handwriting in straight lines with justified margins as signs of the work of professional scribes. Many, but not all, literary texts are neatly written by professional scribes using “square” Hebrew letters, with strictly justified margins. Liturgical poetry, for example, whether written by a scribe or not, might have an unjustified left margin, with a pattern of longer and shorter lines, like poetry in English, but read from right to left. Careful layout, good margins, and straight lines of beautiful script indicate to me that a fragment is “literary,” but other literary fragments (sermons, for example) may lack these features. I’m often unsure what type of fragment I’m looking at, so I like to read the notes on a fragment from the library that holds it, and any comments at the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> site. This slows my volunteer work, but greatly enriches my experience.</p>
<p>The documentary texts are widely varied. Many legal documents, for example, look like the work of professional scribes. Letters from one merchant to another, some with margins crammed full of text written at an angle to the main text, look urgent rather than orderly. Still others are scrawled on re-used scraps of paper in handwriting that is far from well trained. That was true of the “communal register” which you mentioned during our panel last April. In those fragments, a less skilled writer kept dated weekly records that always included some simple math sums. What might these fragments be?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Just as you have noted, Steffy, besides the layout of texts and the economical usage of paper, some other features for assessing the genre of Geniza fragments lie in script usage and the distribution of numerical figures. Square Hebrew letters, or “ מרובע / merūbaʿ,” are indeed a helpful indicator for tracing sacred literary texts. In the period I work on, between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, many Geniza texts begin to bear the influence of Sephardi <em>rashi</em> and <em>solitreo</em> scripts. As a result of the immigration of Sephardi refugees into Egypt across the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries—but especially after the Spanish expulsion of the 1492 CE—Geniza fragments portray the increased influence of Iberian systems of Hebrew script.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Studying <em>solitreo</em> letter forms—which were more commonly used in writing Judeo-Spanish—can also be helpful for understanding how a variety of documents from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries incorporate cursive writing. So, for example, in the Judeo-Arabic communal register I referenced during our panel, on occasion, there are interconnected letters in repeating words such as “berakha / blessing / ברכה” (in purple), “fiḍḍa / silver / פצה” (in green), and “seder / order / סדר” (in red).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> These cursive forms give the initial impression of messiness and lack of scribal skill yet it’s crucial to recognize the pragmatic significance of this writing method. Connecting letters and abbreviating Judeo-Arabic words such as “ת׳׳ע / t[asāwī] ʿa[la]” (in blue) increased the speed at which a scribe could record notes when calligraphic aesthetics were not the objective.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The surnames mentioned in each list–such as Vialobos, Ḥadād, and Skenderī –embody the lives of individuals and families who experienced one of the most turbulent periods in Egyptian political history. Between 1798–1801 CE, the Egyptian populace withstood immense hardship in their efforts to defeat the French occupation and then between 1801–1805 as Ottoman military factions fought to assert their control over the province (a process which resulted in Muḥammad ʿAlī&rsquo;s rise to power as Pasha/Governor). What makes these register entries so significant, then, is that they offer a continuous internal perspective on how Cairene Jews supported their communal institutions during a period of harrowing instability.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> In my dissertation, I am working to compile the donation data from the many page fragments of these registers. This line of investigation may have never emerged in my research had it not been for my chance encounter with Steffy’s collection in the <em>Scribes</em> database.</p>
<p><strong>Steffy:</strong> Shortly after I began volunteering in early 2018, a batch of these oddly similar fragment images started to pop up. Volunteers could tell these Hebrew script fragments were the work of a single less skilled writer but not why he had written so many similar-looking notes. They did not look like religious texts, legal documents, or letters.</p>
<p>A basic task for the “citizen humanists” who volunteer in the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> project is to try to sort images of the fragments which accumulated in the Geniza for nearly a thousand years into two piles: those in Hebrew script, and those which display some Arabic script. Even for volunteers who, like me, cannot read these scripts, this is usually easy to do.</p>
<p>As I wondered what these fragments were, I realized that each one had areas which showed math sums done in Eastern Arabic numerals.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Perhaps these fragments were entries in a ledger recording an activity which might interest an historian someday?</p>
<p>I had just begun keeping a list on paper of these fragments when one with an Arabic seal (a rare feature which volunteers are asked to report) and large, beautiful Arabic writing on one side appeared on my computer screen. Startled, I decided to make a digital collection of these fragments, hoping that they might be useful to someone’s scholarly research.</p>
<p>But I never imagined that I would meet that person.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as more and more of these fragments turned up and added to my collection, <em>Scribes</em> project researchers Jasmin Shinohara and Professor Marina Rustow provided information about the dates and partial translation of the text of the fragments.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> I am very grateful to them both for that information, and for giving time and attention to the curiosity of a new volunteer at <em>Scribes</em> who wondered what she was looking at.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Likewise, when I mentioned the <em>Scribes</em> user &ldquo;Citsci-Rancho&rsquo;&rsquo; during our panel discussion I had hoped they might be watching the panel or eventually see the recording. The serendipity of being able to collaborate on and to answer these questions is a rare opportunity. The seal you included in the register collection is crucial for two reasons. Its significance lies, firstly, in the dating– where the Hijrī year ١١٧٧/1177 AH or 1763/64 CE is visible (in purple):<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

<p>When we read the Hijrī year 1177 AH on the recycled paper against the dating of the upper layer of usage (September 29–October 5, 1799)– a difference of roughly 35 years emerges.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> This timespan marks the initial lifecycle of a piece of paper that lost its utility but was later cut up and bound within a communal register. As Rustow has shown with medieval Geniza sources, early modern ones too can help us analyze the periodicity of paper recycling in Egypt.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The other point of significance with this seal is that the register entries recorded over it reference a specific congregation and synagogue in Cairo: “ק׳׳ק תורקייה / K[ehillat] K[odesh] Tūrkīya.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> This connection is critical because it frames one of the communal settings in which these sources were recorded. When we collect in-text locational references, our opportunities multiply for studying the lives of individuals: more specifically, in tracing their donorship activities and congregational membership.</p>
<p>Steffy’s and my own initial encounters with these fragments have yielded a chain of shared findings that ties back into a broader web of individual contributions in the <em>Scribes</em> database. The initial results of this network of collaboration and those on the horizon underscore the stakes of crowdsourcing in historical research. Moreover, our findings capture the continued resonance of Solomon Schechter’s words when he stated:</p>
<p>“<em>The Geniza is a world, with all its religious and secular aspirations, longings and disappointments, and it requires a world to interpret a world, or at least a large staff of workers</em>.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Jessica L. Goldberg and Eve Krakowski offer a helpful overview of the distinctions between literary and documentary fragments: “forms of <em>geniza</em> practice varied not only among communities but also over time, with some periods during which the Ben Ezra Geniza was in use seeing significant deposits of non-sacred material. Most of the Geniza papers–about 380,000 folio pages in all–are fragments of literary manuscripts, largely on religious subjects. But somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand fragments are what is usually termed <em>documentary material</em>; that is, they are everyday writings, texts written not to convey ideas to an anonymous and long-lasting audience but to communicate with specific recipients for immediate practical purposes.” Jessica L. Goldberg and Eve Krakowski, “Introduction: A Handbook for Documentary Geniza Research in the Twenty-First Century,” in “Documentary Geniza Research in the Twenty-First Century,” eds.
