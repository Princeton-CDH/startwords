One of the core issues embedded in natural language processing (NLP) models for historical languages is the acute lack of annotated datasets, despite the long scholastic and exegetical traditions for some of these languages. This article focuses on a specific historical language with an extensive commentarial tradition: premodern forms of Chinese spanning the Warring States (476&ndash;221 BCE) and early imperial (221 BCE&ndash;220 CE) periods. By highlighting the challenges of this particular language and our approach to building an NLP model that aims to overcome these difficulties, we will argue how textual commentaries from the medieval period can be used for NLP model training purposes.</p>
<p>It may at first appear that the goal of an NLP model for historical languages consists in building the largest model and extracting the highest accuracy score from it. Conventional wisdom holds that larger is better when it comes to datasets, particularly for modern languages, in order to build a seemingly complete picture of the target language.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It may be equally tempting to rely on the currently dominant focus in NLP by building contextual representations of meaning in the form of word embeddings. (This is nowhere more apparent than in the currently ubiquitous assertion that &ldquo;attention is all you need&rdquo; in the Transformer architecture.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>)</p>
<p>But when approaching a language like Old Chinese, the architecture and hyperparameters<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> of the model itself are, at best, of secondary concern. In reality, the bulk of time and effort is devoted to questions of data curation and the painstaking labor necessary to identify and annotate the unique qualities of this language.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> As we will see, the question of meaning in context is far more complex than counting the collection of words surrounding the one we happen to be interested in, as the Transformer architecture would imply. Additional considerations include questions like: Who will curate the corpus of texts? How will this corpus be made machine readable? What portions will be used for the training and evaluation of the model?</p>
<p>In the project we introduce here<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> &mdash; the result of a collaboration between a software engineer and a philologist &mdash; we generate an NLP model based on data derived from premodern Chinese annotations. In many ways, we have found that questions facing the twenty-first-century researcher equipped with large language models and Python libraries echo those of the sixth-century scholar using brush and ink.</p>
<h2 id="i">I.</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by describing some of the distinctive features of Old Chinese, a language that survives in a corpus of ancient texts that can be dated to the centuries preceding and during the first dynasties of Imperial China, or roughly 476 BCE to 220 CE. These written texts survive either as documents that were transmitted and copied through the millennia, or as recently excavated or otherwise surfaced manuscripts.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>For heuristic purposes, we use the term &ldquo;Old Chinese&rdquo; for the underlying language, and like other stages of the Chinese language family, it is marked by the usage of Chinese characters or glyphs. As a writing system, Chinese glyphs have remained largely stable from the Han dynasty (202 BCE&ndash;220 CE) to the present day, with the greatest change occurring in 1956 in the form of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rsquo;s script reform and the introduction of simplified characters. A text from the early twentieth century may thus on the surface appear indistinguishable from a genuinely ancient piece of writing. This is in particular the case due to the venerated status of a few classical texts, largely from pre-imperial China, which served as models for later literary forms of writing up until the twentieth century. Existing NLP models for premodern Chinese assume a seemingly enduring and unchanging use of the written language, grouped under the notions of &ldquo;Literary&rdquo; or &ldquo;Classical Chinese&rdquo; (<em>wen yan</em> 文言 and <em>gudian Hanyu</em> 古典漢語).<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> But this understanding of a never-changing and static language is not just ahistorical and incorrect; it also misses the point of what Chinese glyphs inherently represent: like other forms of writing, they are a conventionalized system used to represent the dynamic utterances of a language.</p>
<p>In this sense, <em>sound</em> is crucial to reading early Chinese texts, and the content of these texts is often inextricably linked to the topic of sound: the Chinese classics and texts of the genre of Masters literature (<em>zi shu</em> 子書) are astoundingly rich in puns, rhymes, and wordplay.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Often, these texts present themselves as representing speech, and many of them may have had performative functions and poetic features that remain largely hidden, simply due to the fact that the Chinese writing system only poorly reflects its phonological features.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> The conceit of continuous access to written heritage is thus a mirage.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    The sound system of the language underwent significant changes even as its graphemes remained static.
</blockquote>
<p>So how can we access the sounds of a language that lost its last native speakers millennia ago? Chinese &mdash; like other languages &mdash; has changed over time. More specifically, the sound system of the language underwent significant changes even as its graphemes remained static. Old Chinese phonology is therefore a reconstructed system, derived from documentary evidence. In this context, heteronyms pose an issue also present in modern forms of Chinese: characters whose pronunciation and meaning change based on context, defying attempts to convert them directly into phonemes.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> One of the best-known examples of such a homograph is the glyph 樂, which can be read &mdash; depending on context &mdash; as either <em>lè</em> (&ldquo;joy&rdquo;) or <em>yuè</em> (&ldquo;music&rdquo;) in modern Standard Chinese, which can be reconstructed as *[rˤ]awk or *[ŋ]ˤrawk in Old Chinese.</p>

<p>Another problem is the graphic variation common in early forms of Chinese, especially prior to the large-scale standardization of orthography during the third to first centuries BCE. In other words, while one glyph could be pronounced multiple ways, the <em>same</em> word could additionally be written with different glyphs in ancient texts. The same textual passage &mdash; say, a line of a poem &mdash; could hence be written with rather different glyphs.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Thus without a model that incorporates homographs, graphic variation, and other contextual understandings of phonology, the (often quite complex) puns, rhymes, and wordplays of ancient texts remain hidden below their surface forms. More crucially, however, unstandardized recurrences &mdash; not just of named entities, but of entire parallel passages &mdash; may go unnoticed.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Fortunately, previous scholarship has grappled with many of these issues, and historical secondary sources offer an intriguing source of semi-structured data in the form of commentaries, dictionaries, and other scholarly work. The <em>Qieyun</em> 切韻, a rhyme dictionary compiled in 601 CE, is an important example: it records normative reading practices that represent a compromise between then-current Northern and Southern styles of pronouncing of glyphs in the classical texts from early China. Modern reconstructions of Old Chinese phonology draw heavily on the <em>Qieyun</em> and its later redactions, as these texts provide a formal structure and closed system of phonological distinctions for the underlying Middle Chinese.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">

<p>The stability of the script also led to problems over time. In China, generations of medieval and early modern writers were trained to memorize the Odes of the ancient <em>Shi jing</em> 詩經 &mdash; called the <em>Classic of Poetry</em> for a good reason &mdash; but they soon grappled with the fact that these texts largely did not to rhyme when read aloud.

<h2 id="ii">II.</h2>
<p>Instead of annotating early Chinese texts manually to disambiguate these problems in reading a given passage, we decided to rely entirely on traditional Chinese scholarship on the ancient classics as a data source. In order for such premodern scholarship to be fruitfully utilized as a data source for NLP training purposes, and for such scholarship to address the problem of disambiguating different readings, several criteria must be met. Initially, the source text must provide phonological data as explicitly as possible &mdash; after all, our aim is to assemble a language model that meaningfully reflects not just the glyphs used, but also their underlying sounds. Secondly, older scholarly sources are better; however, unlike Middle Chinese, which offers a convenient textual starting point in the form of the <em>Qieyun,</em> approaching Old Chinese inevitably includes Middle Chinese data, given the significantly closer temporal proximity of medieval scholars &mdash; like the <em>Qieyun</em>&rsquo;s compilator Lu Fayan 陸法言 (ca. 581&ndash;618) &mdash; to the ancient classics. Thirdly, data is needed on pronunciations given in realistic contexts in order to overcome the problems of homographs and graphic variation. That way, a future model of ours can use this contextual information to improve its accuracy.</p>
<p>One early work appears to fulfill all of these criteria: the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> 經典釋文, completed in 583 CE by the scholar Lu Deming 陸德明 (d. 630). This monumental commentary provides tens of thousands of phonological, semantic, and bibliographic notes across a representative selection of sixteen ancient classical texts. The material being annotated is broad, ranging from poetic odes (the <em>Shi jing</em>) and historical chronicles (the <em>Chunqiu</em> 春秋 and its commentaries) to an ancient dictionary (the <em>Erya</em> 爾雅). Lu Deming&rsquo;s analysis draws from some 230 sources, some of which are not attested in any other work.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Lu Deming’s meticulous attention to detail produced what is effectively a machine-readable dataset millennia before such machines would exist.
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> wrestles with some of the same problems we face today, as its commentarial style disambiguates homographs and the inconsistencies presented by graphic variation in the texts it studies. While Lu Deming lived during a tumultuous period that spanned multiple imperial dynasties and spawned many competing schools of thought on how the classics should be read, his explanatory annotations eventually received official recognition and earned him posthumous fame and a commendation from emperor Taizong 太宗 (598&ndash;649) of the Tang dynasty 唐 (618&ndash;907 CE).<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> utilizes a relatively novel form of commentary: rather than reproducing the source text in full, it instead lists only what we call headwords, which are short excerpts, ranging from single glyphs to short passages. Each of these short sequences of glyphs is paired with a corresponding annotation. Each headword is distinctive enough to be matched to its location in the full text of the original source. The <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> is thus a semi-structured text that provides sequences of glyphs that can be located in specific contexts in the source texts, and supplies annotations for a specific glyph in the relevant sequence.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> By essentially compressing the source texts in this way, the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> manages to cover almost 900,000 characters of primary-source material in just over 100,000 characters of excerpt. The resulting &ldquo;compression ratio&rdquo; is 13:1.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

<p>While earlier dictionaries primarily glossed glyphs by providing similar-sounding glyphs to indicate their reading, the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> employed a rather novel way of indicating pronunciation: the <em>fanqie</em> 反切 system.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> This method of noting a glyph&rsquo;s phonology separates a syllable into its initial consonant on the one hand, and its rhyme and tone on the other. No longer constrained to providing pronunciations by finding a word that overlapped exactly in sound, the <em>fanqie</em> system allowed scholars such as Lu Deming to instead choose common graphs for the initial and rhyme plus tone independently. Given the reliance on the Chinese script, both initial and rhyme plus tone are expressed through a common glyph.</p>

<p>In this way, the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> is both comprehensive and concise in the way it provides phonological data in context. We believe it provides enough data to train an NLP model. The key question is then how to extract this data; while Lu Deming&rsquo;s meticulous attention to detail produced what is effectively a machine-readable dataset millennia before such machines would exist, adjusting the specific format still necessitates significant labor on our part.</p>
<h2 id="iii">III.</h2>
<p>The first obstacle we face in turning the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> into phonological training data is the need for a digitized version of this text. Fortunately, the Kanseki Repository, an online database of premodern Chinese texts, offers digitized editions of over nine thousand works, including the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> and the source texts it annotates.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> This repository usually offers multiple editions for each work, in addition to interpretive versions that attempt to merge the editions into a state-of-the-art copy of the text. In keeping with the repository&rsquo;s permissive licensing and spirit of &ldquo;electronic texts by researchers, for researchers,&rdquo; our own work is available under an open license and published on GitHub.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Only with such a digitized version of the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> and related texts can we approach the key question of how to extract useful phonological data from Lu Deming&rsquo;s commentary. A look at the content of this text highlights why this question is crucial: while close to one-third of the roughly 55,000 notes in the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> consist solely of a reading gloss (thus providing a reading aid to indicate pronunciation), the remainder is more complex and addresses multiple concerns. Some annotations feature semantic glosses, and others highlight instances in which additional works reproduce a glyph differently or include citations to the interpretations of other scholars. Many annotations combine these different elements. More importantly, the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> contains yet another form of abridgement: instead of reproducing the same annotation multiple times, the text attaches qualifiers to indicate that a given reading applies every time a human reader encounters the given string of glyphs in a specific section of the source text. These qualifiers act as multipliers for the data, effectively extending the commentary to cover whole swaths of text not explicitly noted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Our approach to handling these complexities is to train a special-purpose model equipped to parse the terse style of the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em>&rsquo;s highly structured annotations. We use the Prodigy annotation tool to note parts of speech and syntactic relationships in the commentary, and pair it with the spaCy NLP library to create a custom processing pipeline.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> By applying this micro-model to the annotation corpus, each individual reading gloss can be extracted and paired with qualifying data. A notable side effect of this approach is that it simultaneously produces a citation network dataset: references that the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> makes to other texts and authors can be extracted from the text along with phonological data.</p>
<p>Once we have extracted all of the relevant phonological data, the task still remains to transform it into reconstructed forms of first Middle Chinese, and then Old Chinese. This is a process involving a few considerations: while the reading glosses of the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> &mdash; given directly and in <em>fanqie</em> form &mdash; reflect Middle Chinese, these glosses can also be used to make some inferences about the earlier Old Chinese. In order to strengthen these inferences, we use the reading glosses provided by the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> as disambiguation data and cross-reference these glosses with both contemporary rhyme dictionaries like the <em>Qieyun</em> and modern historical linguistic data (primarily William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart&rsquo;s 2014 reconstruction of Old Chinese<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>). The overall goal is to stay as true as possible to the source material: if the rhyming portion of a syllable can be determined, but its initial consonant is represented ambiguously in the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em>, we attempt to capture that ambiguity in the data.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    We borrow a strategy from the modern science of bioinformatics: specifically, genetic algorithms designed to find the best overall “alignment” of sequences of amino acids (or, in our case, sequences of glyphs).
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, in order to create a fully machine-readable dataset, we reunite the annotations of the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> with the full text of the classical works that it annotates. Because of the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em>&rsquo;s tendency to economize on space by attaching comments to excerpted headwords, identifying the precise locations in the text where the headwords occur is necessary to match the annotations to their original context. To do this, we borrow a strategy from the modern science of bioinformatics: specifically, genetic algorithms designed to find the best overall &ldquo;alignment&rdquo; of sequences of amino acids (or, in our case, sequences of glyphs).<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Once the headwords have been matched to their original positions in the source text, we copy over their corresponding phonological data to obtain a dataset of reading glosses in their historical context.</p>
<p>In using historical secondary sources for training an NLP model, we have found that even sources compiled millennia ago can still be considered by their very nature semi-structured data of the type needed to construct a model. The constrained, formulaic syntax of dictionaries and commentaries &mdash; an unnatural language designed to be quickly parsed by a human reader &mdash; lends itself equally well to parsing by relatively simple algorithms. For historical languages, secondary sources may even form a substantial part of the entire known body of the language, providing invaluable contemporary context to their literary counterparts.</p>
<p>Our project continues the practice of reading classical texts as data, but with a different aim than previous iterations of this practice: our goal is to produce a machine-learning algorithm. Some of the outlined steps that we have used to parse the <em>Jingdian Shiwen</em> are still works in progress, and additionally, some of the most difficult work remains to be approached. Constructing a statistical model that can represent all the complexities of current hypotheses regarding Old Chinese syllables will strain the limits of contemporary NLP platforms, most of which have no concept whatsoever of phonology. Our aim here is to persuade our peers that this task, and others like it in other languages, is not just possible but wholly worthwhile for researchers in the humanities. For this reason, we believe that further collaboration &mdash; with digital humanists, philologists, and others interested in expanding the debates around ancient texts to incorporate sound &mdash; is one of the most generative approaches to making use of NLP frameworks in the study of ancient texts.</p>

With the support of a wide range of <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/tools-of-the-trade/sponsors/">funding sources from Harvard and abroad</a>, over 150 participants attended from the United States, Europe, and East Asia. The papers and plenary sessions covered over three thousand years of East Asian history, included multiple East Asian languages and scripts, and featured new databases, platforms, and methodologies in DH research.</p>
<p>The participants represented an equally wide range of national centers and East Asian, European, and U.S. institutions; unsurprisingly, junior scholars were especially active throughout the conference. As Alíz Horváth and Hilde De Weerdt noted in their recent introduction to a special issue of the <em>International Journal of Digital Humanities</em> on East Asian DH, the rapid expansion of computational and data-driven research in East Asian studies is everywhere in evidence: in new dissertations, journals, conferences, job opportunities, and workshops.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Now seems to be a good moment for East Asianists across institutions to strategize about sharing resources.
</blockquote>
<p>Interest among East Asianists in new tools and methods can be seen among scholars across the globe, but it is clear that East Asian nations are leading the way in terms of public funding for this new work at top universities, libraries, and national centers. The Harvard conference also, and perhaps unexpectedly, shed light on the uneven institutional landscape in North America for DH research in East Asian studies and prompted reflections on how institutions might collaborate to promote this work more effectively and systematically. In the current structure of graduate education in the U.S., many PhDs are trained in area studies departments at institutions that may or may not have DH centers like those at Princeton, <a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/">Stanford University,</a> and the <a href="https://dh.library.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia</a>, for example. They may also have limited access to skills workshops aimed at humanists, such as those that have been sponsored at the annual meeting of the <a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/">Association for Asian Studies</a>, the field organization that has also launched <a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/grants-awards/striving-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-asian-studies-humanities-grants-for-asian-studies-scholars/aas-fellowships/#aas-digital-humanities-fellowships">new DH fellowships</a>. Senior advisors may be slow to recognize the potential of DH in East Asian studies, and many junior scholars are necessarily self-taught in the tools, methods, and software that are changing their fields.</p>
<p>National organizations like the <a href="https://www.mellon.org/search/digital%20humanities">Mellon Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/resources-for-applicants-to-the-NEH-office-of-digital-humanities">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> have been generous, enthusiastic funders of DH research, including training programs at a range of smaller and medium-sized institutions; such programs are of course highly competitive and limited in number. But given the rapid growth and significance of computational research in East Asian studies, as well as some of the language- and script-specific challenges that East Asian data and corpora pose, now seems to be a good moment for East Asianists <em>across</em> institutions to strategize about sharing resources and creating new opportunities &mdash; in order to increase access for more scholars and build out East Asian humanities more broadly.</p>
<p>Many possibilities spring to mind, some of which are already underway, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>cross-institutional partnerships to sponsor online workshops (that could be archived for viewing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the creation of open-source textbooks aimed at teaching digital toolkits to East Asian specialists, which could be implemented in graduate training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collaboration among libraries with strong East Asian digital resources to share (within necessary restrictions) materials and tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether or not scholars wish to incorporate data and computational methods in their research on East Asia after having access to these opportunities, such efforts would increase awareness of the potential of those methods, work to lessen the barriers to understanding new tools, and increase DH literacy within and across national borders.</p>

It was the capital of the Western Han (202 BCE&ndash;8 CE) and the Tang (618&ndash;907) dynasties: the twin peaks of imperial power in premodern China. In its heyday during the Tang dynasty, the area covered by the walled city (84.1 square kilometers) was even bigger than many modern metropoles, such as the island of Manhattan (59.1 square kilometers). When you visit the modern city Xi&rsquo;an now, you can still see the remnants of the Han dynasty city of Chang&rsquo;an to the northwest of the modern city center and, much more prominently, of the Tang city of Chang&rsquo;an that overlaps with a large part of the modern city. As I witnessed firsthand walking the crowded streets of Xi&rsquo;an during the sweltering summer of 2023, there is a tremendous amount of interest in the history of Chang&rsquo;an among the general population, partly because of the remains of the ancient city, partly triggered by fictional works like the popular novel and TV drama <em>The Longest Day in Chang&rsquo;an</em>.</p>
<p>Because of Chang&rsquo;an&rsquo;s historical significance, there have been efforts to map it since the Han dynasty.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The earliest extant maps date to 1080 in the Northern Song dynasty (960&ndash;1127), when a group of local elites created a map of the city itself and maps of the palaces.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> These maps are also the earliest city maps in Chinese history. Subsequently, maps of Chang&rsquo;an were made often as a part of a &ldquo;local gazetteer,&rdquo; a kind of geographically based compilation of local historical information.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Such production continued into, and in many cases beyond, the Qing dynasty (1644&ndash;1911). In the twentieth century, historians and geographers began producing a kind of &ldquo;historical map&rdquo; (<em>lishi ditu</em>) that was intended to show the geographical contours of a place in a specific historical period. Chang&rsquo;an, once again, was a center of scholarly interest in the production of such maps.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    During the building of an extensive subway system in 2006, many ancient tombs, old sites, and forgotten treasure hoards were excavated and rediscovered.
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, two trends that accelerated in the late twentieth century threaten to make these thoughtfully crafted historical maps obsolete, while offering new opportunities to reconceptualize how we represent Chang&rsquo;an geographically. The first is new archaeological discoveries that have been appearing at a breathtaking pace. Because of the explosive economic development of Xi&rsquo;an in the past half century and the accompanying construction of new infrastructure &mdash; notably during the building of an extensive subway system in 2006 &mdash; many ancient tombs, old sites, and forgotten treasure hoards were excavated and rediscovered. In the span of one year from 2021 to 2022, for instance, archaeologists found over 1,200 old tombs just from the west side of the city.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> These finds substantially changed our understanding of the shape of the city. When I visited an archaeological site in the summer of 2023, I observed how archaeologists uncovered a previously unknown section of the Zhuque boulevard &mdash; the main north-south axis of the Tang city &mdash; and found five unrecorded bridges over the boulevard. Such new discoveries far outpace the revision of traditional print books and atlases and cannot be properly and promptly reflected in these works.</p>
<p>At the same time, the development of GIS (Geographic Information System) technology, the use of portable GPS devises, app-based location services, and new developments in the field of digital humanities also made it possible to imagine a new kind of &ldquo;deep map&rdquo; that can incorporate and consolidate a huge amount of data, and to visualize them in ways that are easy to digest and manipulate. This deep map ideally will incorporate all the existing historical data about Chang&rsquo;an, store and organize those textual, visual, and archaeological data in accessible and sensible ways, and visualize them in various forms for open-access use. This essay reflects some of my initial thinking as I begin to conceptualize this project, one that is certainly beyond the capacity of one person. To do so, I first examine existing maps of Chang&rsquo;an produced by premodern cartographers and modern scholars, and discuss their uses and limits. Then I assess the nature of the data now at our disposal that are the basis of a &ldquo;deep map&rdquo; of Chang&rsquo;an, and envision what kind of things this new map can do for us, as researchers, students, and even tourists of modern Xi&rsquo;an.</p>
<h2 id="existing-historical-maps">Existing Historical Maps</h2>
<p>To make new maps, we need to understand what &ldquo;old&rdquo; maps look like. Although maps were continuously made about Chang&rsquo;an from the Han to the Tang dynasties, the earliest preserved map of Chang&rsquo;an dates, as mentioned earlier, to the eleventh and twelfth century in the Northern Song dynasty (960&ndash;1127). Along with the map itself, a colophon was carved on a stone and preserved in later written sources, that allows us to understand the cartographic thinking of its creators. According to the colophon, the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; (<em>fa</em> 法) for the production of this map is as follows:<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sui capital city (which later became the Tang capital city) itself and the Daming Palace (a Tang palace located to the northeast of the capital city) are both converted on the scale of one <em>li</em> (about 460 meters) to two <em>cun</em> (each <em>cun</em> is about three centimeters). For [areas] outside of the city that are incorporated into the map, such principle of conversion does not apply. [This map] is largely based on old maps and the <span style="font-style: normal;">Record of the Western Capital</span> by Wei Shu; we also consulted many other books and investigated traces of old sites. This conversion method does not allow us to show the many halls . . . within the three Palaces, the Taiji, the Daming, and the Xingqing, so we made additional maps [for these three Palaces].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colophon then continues to record the sizes of the Han dynasty Chang&rsquo;an, which was included in the map, and of the Tang city, along with the number of wards in the city, the lengths and heights of walls, and the names of city gates. From this colophon, we learn two lessons about the principle of making this map of Chang&rsquo;an.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    This early map of Chang&rsquo;an was created on the basis of textual evidence, earlier maps, ground surveys, and possibly even archaeological data.
</blockquote>
<p>First, the eleventh-century cartographers made use of a wide range of data, including old maps (presumably those made in the Tang dynasty), textual records of Chang&rsquo;an (especially the <em>Record of the Western Capital</em> composed by a Tang author Wei Shu in 722),<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and personal investigations of extant sites. The leader of this project Lü Dafang (1027&ndash;1097) was from a local Chang&rsquo;an family, and served as the governor of the Chang&rsquo;an region when the map was made. His brother Lü Dalin (1044&ndash;1091), a famous antique collector, also participated in making corrections to drafts of the map. Therefore, Lü Dafang and his team must have been intimately familiar with the area and many of the ancient sites that were still visible.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Given that the Lü family members have been engaged in archaeological investigations in the past, it is possible that the two brothers also excavated old sites in their making of the map of Chang&rsquo;an.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Therefore, this early map of Chang&rsquo;an was created on the basis of textual evidence, earlier maps, ground surveys, and possibly even archaeological data.</p>
<p>Second, the method of incorporating these data on a two-dimensional surface is also revolutionary. For the core of the map &mdash; the Sui-Tang city and the three Tang palaces &mdash; the cartographers strived to represent them accurately by following a consistent scale of conversion, about 1:7,666. Within this core, information regarding specific places is included on the basis of textual information. For instance, for the Pingkang Ward to the northeast of the city, a ward renowned among the 110 or so wards in the city for its pleasure quarters, the map includes the name of the ward itself (<em>Pingkang fang</em> 平康坊) carved in the middle of the ward; the names of important sites are placed in different areas of the ward, including Buddhist monasteries and the residences of famous officials like Chu Suiliang (596&ndash;658). These sites are represented by a simple line drawing of a small house, reflecting the influence of Chinese painting at the time.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> In reality, however, each of these residences and monasteries must have consisted of many individual units of houses. Beyond the city core, areas were represented primarily for inclusion rather than precision.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> The entire southern suburb of the city, which stretched for about thirty to fifty kilometers from the southern wall of the Sui-Tang city to the Zhongnan mountains, was compressed into a narrow strip at the bottom of the map.</p>

<p>From this brief introduction, we can see that, although remarkably accurate in its representation of the basic structures of the city (the walls, palaces, wards, and locations of gates), this unprecedented accomplishment in the early history of Chinese cartography nevertheless falls short in capturing the full richness of the city of Chang&rsquo;an in a number of ways. Due to spatial limitations, the cartographers can only include a number of the most important sites, and in a much simplified way. This one map also cannot represent the changes that occurred within the space of the city, but rather combines parts of the city the developed from different times and places them on the same map. For instance, the Daming Palace was not part of the city&rsquo;s original plan but was instead built several decades into the Tang dynasty. In this way, the map is not an accurate reflection of the city at any specific time, but an atemporal picture. Finally, because of the need to produce a map that is largely square for easy viewing and reproduction, the cartographers had to sacrifice accuracy for areas outside of the city, and squeeze in as best they could places they deemed important. The result was a rather distorted picture of the areas around Chang&rsquo;an.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Lü&rsquo;s eleventh-century map remained <span style="font-style: normal;">the</span> standard Chang&rsquo;an map until the late twentieth century.
</blockquote>
<p>These issues with the otherwise revolutionary map would not be addressed, or perhaps even recognized, for centuries. The maps of Chang&rsquo;an produced after Lü Dazhong&rsquo;s map in the Southern Song through the Qing dynasties, though interesting in their own ways, were as a rule even less accurate and less rich than the Northern Song map.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Therefore, Lü&rsquo;s eleventh-century map remained <em>the</em> standard Chang&rsquo;an map until the late twentieth century, when scholars began using newer technology to produce new kinds of maps of Chang&rsquo;an. The culmination of such &ldquo;modern&rdquo; scholarship is the <em>Historical Atlas of Xi&rsquo;an</em> (<em>Xi&rsquo;an lishi dituji</em>) published by the historical geographer Shi Nianhai in 1996.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Shi&rsquo;s atlas contains eighty-nine maps of the Xi&rsquo;an region from Neolithic times down to the late twentieth century. It is arranged chronologically, with an emphasis on the Han and Tang dynasties. In particular, there are twenty maps of the Sui-Tang city, which account for almost a quarter of the whole atlas.</p>
<p>In important ways, this atlas followed the practice of Lü Dazhong&rsquo;s map. It included maps of the Sui-Tang city itself, but also maps of the three Tang palaces.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> But it also addressed the issues of Lü Dazhong&rsquo;s map in several ways. For the city itself, the 1996 atlas included several kinds of maps, such as a map of residential units, one on commercial establishments, one on religious institutions, and one on gardens, wells, canals, and springs.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> In this way, it contained a significantly richer array of information than the eleventh-century map. By presenting three maps (Sui dynasty Chang&rsquo;an, early Tang Chang&rsquo;an before 755, and late Tang Chang&rsquo;an after 756), the atlas tries to capture the historical changes of the urban space in the three centuries of the Sui-Tang empire.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Finally, instead of squeezing the suburban areas into the margins of the main maps, the atlas uses separate maps to represent the southern suburb, an area of villas and monasteries, and the northern suburb, where one finds all the Tang imperial mausoleums. These maps do not use distorted proportions, and are thus more accurate representations of the city and its relation to its environs.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The most notable innovation of this atlas compared to traditional maps is its treatment of archaeological materials. In addition to maps and their accompanying, brief textual explanations, this atlas includes many photographs of archaeological sites &mdash; places of importance that were still visible to visitors &mdash; and archaeological finds. We find images of the ruins of the Han city,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> as well as treasures found in the Tang city and the surrounding Tang tombs.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Uniquely, for the map of the Daming Palace, a site that has been thoroughly excavated, Shi Nianhai and his team include two maps: one based on textual information and the other on archaeological data.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> While they conform to each other to a large extent, the archaeological map includes more concrete shapes of buildings and the textual map contains many more names of places. The mapmakers indicate, subtly perhaps, that the job of future scholars is to further correlate these two groups of sources, both deemed important to the reconstruction of the city of Chang&rsquo;an.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    The Song cartographers&rsquo; treatment of the relation between these two cities reveals a more intimate, and less rigid, understanding of the geographical dimensions of historical change.
</blockquote>
<p>In certain ways, one may argue that the Song dynasty map remains superior in recreating the city to the much more voluminous and accurate 1996 atlas. The Song map&rsquo;s attempt at drawing out the shape of the buildings and gates was largely abandoned in the atlas, where most monasteries were represented by a black dot and residences by a small square. This latter approach might be more cautious, but it also renders the image of the map dull and introduces inaccuracies in its own way. (The Buddhist monasteries were of course not just <em>dots</em>.) More importantly, the Song map includes the Han city to the northwest as an integral part of the Tang city, while the 1996 atlas separates the Han and the Tang cities, representing them in different sections of book. But in the Tang dynasty, the Han city was still prominently visible and frequently visited by Tang emperors. So the Song cartographers&rsquo; treatment of the relation between these two cities reveals a more intimate, and less rigid, understanding of the geographical dimensions of historical change.</p>
<p>There are other efforts to improve upon both the Song and the Shi Nianhai maps. In particular, the works by Heng Chye Kiang and Seo Tatsuhiko contributed significantly to the ways we reimagine Chang&rsquo;an. Heng published a digital reconstruction of the city that, for the first time in history, transformed our view of the city into a 3D one, thus revealing the scale of the city in ways that are impossible for traditional maps.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Seo, on the other hand, followed a traditional format but, by using color coding, thematic arrangements, and geographical correlation &mdash; one of his maps connects the places of residence and places of burial for residents of Chang&rsquo;an &mdash; produced the most aesthetically pleasing and scholarly useful maps to date.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Their work represents the best of existing scholarship on mapping Chang&rsquo;an.</p>
<h2 id="toward-a-deep-map">Toward a Deep Map</h2>
<p>The survey in the previous sections shows that, although there is an abundance of sophisticated scholarship on mapping historical Chang&rsquo;an, the overwhelming majority of approaches follows a tradition of mapmaking that in some ways began with the eleventh-century Song dynasty map of Chang&rsquo;an. These maps are, although extremely useful for certain purposes, static. Once a map is made, it becomes difficult to manipulate it and incorporate new data. On the other hand, unlike these traditional printed maps, &ldquo;deep maps,&rdquo; in the words of David J. Bodenhamer, are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fluid cartographic representations that reveal the complex, contingent, and dynamic context of events within and across time and space. They express the results of research but the answers they provide are not final and the map itself is always open to revision. <sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To achieve such a <em>fluid</em> cartographic representation, &ldquo;within and across time and space,&rdquo; one needs to build a geotemporal database that can be queried, visualized, and regularly updated. The raw materials for such a database include primarily textual sources and archaeological data. To explain how I envision building this database, I will briefly examine the nature of these two kinds of data.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of writing about the city in China, and the writing about Chang&rsquo;an is at the heart of this tradition. The <em>Sanfu huangtu</em>, a work of uncertain date that contained information about early Chang&rsquo;an but was likely compiled much later, offers a textual dissection of the city, listing the palaces, gardens, gates, and streets of the city in the Western Zhou and the Han dynasties.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Under each heading, the book provides a short description of the place, including its location, its history, and famous anecdotes associated with it. This kind of thematic treatment is inherited by later geographies, such as the <em>Leibian Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> produced in the Yuan dynasty (1271&ndash;1368).<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull left">

</blockquote>
<p>Another related kind of local writing began with the Song dynasty <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em>, produced by Song Minqiu (1019&ndash;1079) in 1076.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Song&rsquo;s work includes a historical survey of the Chang&rsquo;an area, including a summary of government institutions, palaces, and cities in the Zhou, the Qin, and the Han dynasties, as well as the city in the Tang dynasty and counties around Chang&rsquo;an. This work is organized according to two different principles. First, the editor separates the materials between the city and the counties around it. Then, on the city, the book follows a chronological order, focusing on the Han and the Tang dynasty. Within the chapters on the city, it then includes textual information about the locations and history of notable sites. For example, the entry on the Pingkang Ward in the Tang city (represented above in the map excerpt, Figure 1) includes detailed information about several notable structures within the ward. An edition of the book printed in 1468 uses large characters to describe the name and location of these structures, while the smaller, double-line notes explain their history and incorporate stories about these places.</p>

<p>Therefore, unlike the thematically organized works mentioned above, the <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> provides more concrete temporal and geographical information that can be associated with the texts it includes. For instance, we can &ldquo;locate&rdquo; the chunk of text about the residence of a notable historical figure geographically in a ward in the city, and temporally in the lifetime of this figure, which is often known or deducible from other sources. Because the <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> provides the most complete list of Han and Tang place names in Chang&rsquo;an and gives their location in a relatively concrete and reliable manner, it has long been the basis for the reconstruction of Chang&rsquo;an in modern scholarship.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> I also use the <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> as a basis for my reconstruction of the city (Figure 2).</p>

<p>In addition to these geographical texts devoted to Chang&rsquo;an, the vast ocean of traditional Chinese historical records includes many more sources for Chang&rsquo;an: in official annals, political treatises, fictions, and poetry, among others. They are associable to different areas of the city because they often mention places in Chang&rsquo;an as the location where the stories transpired. The Pingkang Ward, for instance, was renowned as the pleasure quarter of the city, and many encounters between courtesans and young officials and students are recorded.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> Now that I have established a database of places according to <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em>, information from these other sources can then be added to each record, enriching the dataset as a whole. The result, hopefully, will be an extensive database of textual sources that are, to various degrees of preciseness, locatable in the city of Chang&rsquo;an.</p>
<p>The second kind of data we possess in abundance now comes from archaeology. Unlike textual sources, whose geographical information can often be fuzzy, archaeological data generally contain concrete geographical information. For instance, when a hoard of Tang treasures was discovered in 1970, we know <em>precisely</em> where it was discovered: a modern village called Hejiacun (Figure 4).<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> Then, cross-referencing with textual sources from <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> and others, we can determine that this hoard was located in the southwestern part of the Xinghua Ward on the west side of Chang&rsquo;an.</p>

<p>Thousands of similar archaeological discoveries, from tombs and building foundations to ancient wells and gates, have been made in the past few decades. Almost all of them, when documented in official reports, are placed with a precise location that can be associated with a Tang or Han dynasty place. In this way, these archaeological data can be easily connected to the textual database. Our knowledge about their precise locations means that these archaeological data more easily lend themselves to geometric abstractions than does most textual information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, archaeology does not simply provide additional data, but can help revise and refine the textual data too. The archaeological work on the city itself &mdash; its walls, gates, bridges, and palaces &mdash; gives us a more precise picture of the shape of the city than textual sources and offers details unrecorded in texts. For instance, the excavation of what used to be the Western Market &mdash; the center of foreign trade in Tang Chang&rsquo;an &mdash; revealed details about the internal structure of the market area, including the bridges and water system that must have been crucial to the function of the city (Figure 5). None of these details are recorded in textual sources. Such archaeological data complement, correct, and enrich textual data; a full picture of the city can only become possible if both types of sources are thoroughly incorporated.</p>

<p>What can we do with a database that incorporates both textual and archaeological information? And how would this &ldquo;deep map&rdquo; differ from the existing maps surveyed above? At this point, in the beginning of my project, I can only offer a few conjectural remarks.</p>
<p>As I will be using GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS to organize and visualize my data, the first step &mdash; by no means an easy one &mdash; is to produce a time-layered map of Chang&rsquo;an, the scale of which can be easily manipulated through zooming-in and -out features. Unlike Shi Nianhai&rsquo;s atlas, it is possible to create many more layers of different time periods, considering the changing political and cultural history of the city. The juxtaposition of maps from different eras could help readers better grasp the overlapping constructions in Chang&rsquo;an across different dynasties, which formed a kind of imperial palimpsest. There will also be virtually no limit as to how much information one can include within a certain space. Going back to the Pingkang Ward example, unlike the Song dynasty map that can only include six building complexes, GIS technology allows us to put all the information contained in the <em>Chang&rsquo;an zhi</em> and other sources under the entry of the &ldquo;Pingkang Ward&rdquo; in our database. This large amount of information can then be linked to specific locations on the map, showing either the names of specific buildings or even excerpts from the historical sources on these buildings. These annotations can be placed on a modern basemap like Google Earth&rsquo;s satellite images, or a georeferenced old map like the fragments of the Song dynasty <em>Chang&rsquo;an tu</em>. The result will be a Chang&rsquo;an map of unprecedented detail.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Another aspect of the urban space of Chang&rsquo;an that most existing maps fail to grasp is its three dimensionality. As scholars have shown, the vertical space of Chang&rsquo;an was a central factor in the social life of its residents.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Yet virtually all our existing maps use a bird&rsquo;s-eye perspective, looking down on a two-dimensional city. As we have knowledge about the magnitude of Chang&rsquo;an&rsquo;s tall buildings &mdash; some of the pagodas in Buddhist monasteries rose to over one hundred meters &mdash; and the topographical features of the city &mdash; the Tang imperial palace in the north was the lowest elevational point in the city, and was about fifty to sixty meters lower than the southeastern corner of the city &mdash; it will be possible to incorporate these data into the &ldquo;deep map&rdquo; and offer a better approximation of residents&rsquo; experiences of the city in premodern times.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Fictional accounts like the love story between a courtesan and an aspiring examinee also include factual geographical information that allows us to place the flow of their plots in the space of Chang&rsquo;an.
</blockquote>
<p>What makes a map &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; is its ability to illustrate not only buildings and walls, but also <em>events</em>. There is of course no doubt that many historical events played out in the city since the earliest days of its foundation. But it was not until the Tang dynasty that significant events were recorded in textual sources with (relatively) precise geotemporal information. We know, for instance, how the Xuanwu Gate incident (July 2, 626), in which Li Shimin (598&ndash;649) killed his two brothers and forced his father (the emperor) to designate him as the heir, played out, beat by beat, in different parts of the city. Neither is such knowledge limited to historical events. Fictional accounts like the love story between a courtesan and an aspiring examinee also include factual geographical information that allows us to place the flow of their plots in the space of Chang&rsquo;an.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> The social lives of certain residents and visitors, such as the Japanese Buddhist monk Ennin who visited Chang&rsquo;an in the mid-ninth century, can also be reconstructed with remarkable precision.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> I plan to create subsets of data to document the flow of these events and show them in separate layers of maps. The data thus organized can then be animated, revealing the social lives of the city in ways impossible using printed maps.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This &ldquo;deep map&rdquo; of Chang&rsquo;an will be useful for scholars and students to learn about the city and its history. The collection of a vast amount of textual and archaeological data with new ways to organize and visualize them will certainly lead to new insights into the history and culture of the city. I cannot foresee what these insights will be. In my own research, I have certainly already benefited from even <em>thinking</em> about this deep map: an article I am writing now discusses the continued presence, in Tang Chang&rsquo;an, of physical structures and ghostly beings from the Han dynasty and earlier. The idea for this project came directly from when I tried to overlay the Han city map onto the Tang city map in QGIS. I hope this deep map will be similarly useful to other scholars in their research work.</p>
<p>As Chang&rsquo;an was the capital of China in much of the early and medieval imperial period, a better understanding of the city also would lead to a more intimate knowledge about Chinese history in general. In this sense, a more dynamic and accessible deep map of Chang&rsquo;an will no doubt be of pedagogical value and should be welcome in classrooms of Chinese history and culture, both in introductory lectures and in specialized seminars. A deep map of historical Chang&rsquo;an, if combined with portable GPS devices, will give travelers an augmented experience that no print map can match. These multiple potential uses make this deep map a worthwhile endeavor, and I look forward to the collaboration with other students of China and Chang&rsquo;an in the coming years on this project.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to a map of Chang&rsquo;an is found in a third-century commentary by a certain Ruchun 如淳 on the Han dynasty work <em>Shiji</em>. See Sima Qian 司馬遷, <em>Shiji</em> 史記 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1982), 10.432.

This is the question that &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; productively sets in motion, and that has continued to reverberate throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) community since the paper&rsquo;s release.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is also a question &mdash; or, rather, a more specific version of a question &mdash; that I&rsquo;ve been thinking through for a number of years. In <em>Data Feminism</em>, for example, Catherine D&rsquo;Ignazio and I ask more broadly how datasets and data systems, which so often encode and amplify power differentials, might instead be reimagined so that they can challenge and rebalance those differentials.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> We document myriad instances of biased and incomplete datasets, as well as harmful and oppressive data systems that were conceived without attention to &mdash; let alone the involvement of &mdash; the communities most impacted by those systems.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> We also consider the environmental and economic costs of the computing infrastructure required to support such systems.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Yet we maintain a guarded optimism that data science, if intentionally deployed, can be used to challenge unjust power systems. Throughout the book, we advance a view that it still may be possible to remake the field of data science by building coalitions across communities and taking differential power into account, so as to wield the power of data with care and in the service of justice. The seven principles of data feminism that we describe in the book &mdash; examine power, challenge power, rethink binaries and hierarchies, elevate emotion and embodiment, embrace pluralism, consider context, and make labor visible &mdash; were intended to structure this transformative work.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull right">

<p>But when &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; was released, and when Dr. Gebru and Dr. Mitchell were subsequently fired &mdash; and then subjected to so much harassment and defamation online &mdash; it called into question the degree to which the transformative data science that Catherine and I had described in the book was truly possible.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> With the opportunity to reengage with &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots,&rdquo; as this roundtable has invited us to do, I&rsquo;ve returned to this question of degree, which &mdash; one year later &mdash; now seems more accurately described as a question of bounds: Are large language models (LLMs) our limit case? In other words, are LLMs simply too big, and too ethically, environmentally, and epistemologically compromised, for humanities scholars to abide?</p>
<p>I will admit that I do not yet have a definitive answer to this question. But as a way of working through my current thinking, I will offer three unequivocal assertions:</p>
<div class="interlude">
<ol>
<li>There is no outside of unequal power.</li>
<li>All technologies are imbricated in this unequal power.</li>
<li>Refusal is, in itself, a generative act.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>In what follows, I elaborate each of these points.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>First, there is no outside of unequal power</strong>. This is why an attention to power matters so much for discussions of data and models: it overdetermines not only the data we can collect and the datasets we can access, but also the research questions that we can explore. In <em>Data Feminism</em>, Catherine and I demonstrate how the financial and computational resources required to collect and analyze data at scale result in efforts most often undertaken by large corporations (and other well-resourced institutions) for their own profit and benefit, and at the expense of everyone else. This is why, to take one famous example that we discuss in the book, Target is able to analyze its own customer data in order to predict whether or not a person is pregnant &mdash; and then use that same data to sell them baby products; but there is not enough actual medical data that can be analyzed in order to predict whether that same pregnant person will be at risk of dying in childbirth.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Or, to take an example discussed in &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots,&rdquo; why the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus, even though it is less explicitly sexist, racist, and xenophobic than the Common Crawl corpus from which it is derived, remains sexist and racist and xenophobic in more subtle ways: because it was created by filtering out documents from the Common Crawl corpus that contained one or more words drawn from a list of &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words">Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, or Otherwise Bad Words</a>,&rdquo; it also excludes all discussions <em>about</em> those words &mdash; including direct critiques of those words or, in certain cases, discussions by those who might want to reclaim them.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> More recent research by Gururangan et al. has shown that even more sophisticated quality filters, such as the classifier employed to cull the dataset on which GPT-3 is trained, demonstrate significant stylistic as well as thematic preferences, preferences which correlate with a number of proxies for high socioeconomic status.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Literary and historical corpora are not exempt from the influence of unequal power. We all know (or should know) that the <a href="https://www.hathitrust.org/">HathiTrust corpus</a>, because it is drawn from the collections of major research libraries, reflects the collecting preferences of those libraries (and the preferences of several libraries in particular) rather than literary production writ large.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> More domain-specific corpora, which would seem to avoid some of these issues as a result of their narrower scope, nonetheless continue to fall prey to the politics of digitization, as Katherine Bode and others have astutely observed.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> And those of us who work on texts related to the history of slavery, in particular, have long had to reckon with the politics of the archive itself: the fact that the first-hand accounts that might offer us the most direct access to the lives of the enslaved scarcely exist at all is because of the historical structures of power that control not only what enters the archive but also who is authorized to even write. That there is no outside of this unequal power is the starting point for our work. We must build our datasets and our models with our eyes wide open to this fact. As we acknowledge what we might learn from any new analyses, we must continue to account for the archive&rsquo;s &ldquo;null values,&rdquo; as Jessica Marie Johnson describes them: spaces held open for the people and stories that we know to have existed in their own time, even as they remain unknown to us in the present.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Academic researchers, especially at public institutions, are functionally if not ideologically compelled to concede to this asymmetrical configuration of power and resources.
</blockquote>
<p>Which brings me to my second point: <strong>all technologies are imbricated in this unequal power</strong>. Just as literary and other humanities scholars are deeply attuned to how power shapes both datasets and models, so too are we aware of how technology &mdash; all technology &mdash; is shaped by power as well. One could point to broad histories of computing, statistics, or surveillance for evidence of this fact.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> But we could also look to work that has explored the imbrications of power in specific natural language processing (NLP) and ML techniques themselves. Work by Jeff Binder, for example, has located the origins of topic modeling in the need for U.S. intelligence agencies to quickly scan international newswires for potential geopolitical conflicts.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> Melanie Walsh, for another, has recently reminded us that the annotated <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19">OntoNotes corpus</a>, on which <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy&rsquo;s language models</a> were trained, was developed with funding by the U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) &mdash; as is so much of NLP/ML/AI work today.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> This circles back to a point that Catherine and I make in <em>Data Feminism</em>, about unequal power being the result of unequal resources. This point is made in &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; as well: because these technologies are so resource-dependent, not only in terms of energy, cost, and computing power, but also because of very specific technical expertise, they are necessarily developed by people at elite and well-resourced institutions who are rarely required &mdash; either by inclination or circumstance &mdash; to take power into account.</p>
<p>Meredith Whittaker, another former Google employee forced out because of her labor-organizing efforts there, observes as much in a recent essay that documents the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; of supervised machine learning algorithms (including large language models) by Big Tech.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Whittaker explains how any gains in performance they might achieve are the result not of any major algorithmic or architectural innovation, but rather, of what existing algorithms can do &ldquo;when matched with large-scale data and computational resources.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> These are resources that only big tech firms control. So when academic researchers seek to engage with these developments, they find themselves beholden to the very same tech firms for the data and computing infrastructure, and very often funding, as a necessary precondition for contributing on an equal plane. The systematic defunding of higher education that has taken place over the past several decades is not the focus of Whittaker&rsquo;s piece, but this issue is the other side of the same neoliberal coin. Academic researchers, especially at public institutions, are functionally if not ideologically compelled to concede to this asymmetrical configuration of power and resources as a result of the federal, state, and institutional policies that have transferred the responsibility of supporting and sustaining research (in terms of computing infrastructure, student support, and even their own salaries) to the scholars themselves. And all of this is to say nothing of corporations like Facebook that are actively and intentionally wielding their data and algorithms to retain their own power, even as they know full well the harms that their products produce.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Given this ethical, intellectual, and economic double-bind, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the most clear and compelling response may be to refuse &mdash; to refuse to develop new models, to refuse to improve existing ones, or even to refuse to participate in this work altogether. This brings me to my third assertion: that <strong>refusal is, in itself, a generative act</strong>. I&rsquo;ve long admired the work of Dr. Joy Buolamwini and the <a href="https://www.ajl.org/">Algorithmic Justice League</a> (AJL), for example. This work began (in work coauthored with Dr. Gebru) by identifying biases in the image datasets used to train three major gender classification software libraries.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> But when the initial audit found significant error rates in how the software classified images of women, and images of dark-skinned women in particular, Buolamwini&rsquo;s response was <em>not</em> to suggest that the training data be &ldquo;debiased&rdquo; or otherwise improved.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Rather, because she recognized how improved gender classification software (and facial recognition software more generally) would most likely be used to increase the policing and surveillance of Black and brown people, she used the evidence of her paper with Gebru to instead call for a ban on facial recognition software altogether.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>In terms of text analysis tools more specifically, I&rsquo;ve followed with interest the recent actions by the team behind ml5.js, the JavaScript-based machine learning library, which upon discovering racist language in its sample word2vec model, around which its documentation is based, decided to remove it (and as a result, render the entire library nonfunctional) until an alternate model could be trained.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> In both of these cases, the AJL and ml5.js, we see evidence of how refusal &mdash; especially when accompanied (as feminists advise) by a recommitment to values, or action, or both &mdash; can clear the space to imagine alternate possibilities.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; participates in this reimagining by describing an alternative approach to technical research, one in which issues of cost, access, potential harms, and potential benefits are addressed early in the research process. This slower and more intentional process also allows for input from &mdash; and, ideally, meaningful collaboration with &mdash; impacted communities. This process echoes some of what Catherine and I have described as data science for good vs. data science for co-liberation: the latter imagines a way of doing data science in which those from both dominant and minoritized groups work together to free themselves from the oppressive systems that harm all of us.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>

<p>But the discussion of LLMs at the center of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; complicates this vision of data for co-liberation in necessary ways, because LLMs may well function as a limit case. This is for a number of reasons. For one, the computational resources required to train up larger and larger models may make it infrastructurally impossible to allow anyone from outside of these institutions &mdash; let alone members of minoritized groups &mdash; to assume primary leadership of these models&rsquo; training or future development. The same holds for financial leadership, since LLMs are just as resource-intensive with respect to cost as they are to compute. It is difficult to see how any corporation &mdash; which, by definition, is driven by its own bottom line &mdash; would allow an outside group to independently manage a budget that reflected one of these models&rsquo; true economic cost, even as that same corporation might bestow seemingly generous grants to outside groups for specific purposes.</p>
<p>Along with questions about resources are questions about the models themselves. As the authors of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; spell out, the predictive power of LLMs derives, in large part, from the size of the datasets used to train them. Is it possible for a single community, or even a consortium of impacted groups, to own and govern the increasing amount of training data that is required to train a new model from the ground up? Furthermore, without explainability mechanisms co-designed by communities, rather than by computer scientists alone, how might the results of any particular LLM-based data analysis project be ground-truthed by the community members themselves?</p>
<p>There are additional ethical questions that arise as a result of this range of dependencies. Is it possible for corporations and their own technical workers to participate in a process of knowledge transfer while remaining uncompromised by their profit-driven agenda? How can academic researchers, if brought into this process, ensure that their own values remain uncompromised? What alternative infrastructures &mdash; social, technical, financial, or governmental &mdash; must be imagined such that Big Tech does not remain a required research partner? And even if removed from the corporate sphere, can LLMs &mdash; defined as they are by their size and scale &mdash; ever be enlisted in the necessarily slow, careful, and localized work of building solidarity and shared understanding?</p>

    How can we reconcile the historical specificity that we so value in our own research with the fact that even the most appropriate LLM for historical scholarship may be trained on data so temporally distant from the time period that bounds our own scholarly expertise?
</blockquote>
<p>Quantitative literary and cultural studies scholars can continue to learn from the work that the authors of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; have undertaken since the paper&rsquo;s release (and even since the roundtable which prompted these remarks), which addresses many of these issues head on. For example, in December 2021, Dr. Gebru announced the launch of DAIR, the Distributed AI Research Institute, which is guided by a commitment to &ldquo;ensur[ing] that researchers from many different backgrounds can participate while embedded in their communities.”<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Just a few months earlier, in August 2021, Dr. Mitchell announced that she would be joining Hugging Face, a startup that is working to provide open-source alternatives to the language models produced by the Big Five, as well as software libraries which increase access to existing models and examples of documentation and other best practices.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> Meanwhile, McMillan-Major has continued her work on best practices for documenting the datasets employed in NLP research,<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> while Dr. Bender has continued to draw attention to the limits of LLMs as well as their potential harms, both through publications aimed at the AI, ML, and NLP research communities and in comments addressed to the public at large.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>But certain questions that pertain to humanistic inquiry in particular, both methodological and epistemological, remain to be addressed by quantitative literary and cultural studies scholars. For example, even as there begin to exist LLMs that are trained on historical corpora, the amount of data that is required results in training datasets with timespans &mdash; 1450 to 1950, in the case of MacBERTh &mdash; that far exceed any disciplinary sense of periodization.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> How can we reconcile the historical specificity that we so value in our own research with the fact that even the most appropriate LLM for historical scholarship may be trained on data so temporally distant from the time period that bounds our own scholarly expertise? Furthermore, even as we know to fine-tune such a model on our own more curated datasets, how are we to measure the effects of that fine-tuning in ways that are meaningful to us as humanities scholars? When parameters no longer correspond to specific textual or linguistic features, as with earlier model architectures, we will require even more creative ways to understand the significance of the texts contained in our curated datasets in relation to those on which the larger model was trained.</p>
<p>In addition, we must consider how decades of feminist thinking &mdash; and, for that matter, much of the most profound of humanities scholarship &mdash; have confirmed how a single voice at the margins can tell us just as much as (if not more than) a large group at the center. How do we hold fast to this fact as the allure of LLMs, enlisted as they are in the service of &ldquo;shared&rdquo; or generalizable tasks, continues to mount? How can we envision methods to engage these models in ways that center marginalized voices and the texts that document them? How can we amplify rather than merely assimilate the important oppositional ideas that these texts record? And how can we do so while remaining mindful of the ideas &mdash; and the people behind them &mdash; that these models cannot or at times should not subsume?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions we might, in turn, bring back to the authors of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots,&rdquo; augmenting their vision of the reimagining of large language models and their required infrastructures that must necessarily take place. As humanities scholars, we also must recommit to showing how literary, cultural, and historical context not only enriches our present understanding of LLMs, but is required for all future model-based research. After all, this is the set of contexts from which large language models emerged, and it is only with a deep knowledge of these contexts that we can fully understand their uses and limits.</p>

Some observers point to an architecture, the Transformer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ldquo;On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; focuses on size and discusses &ldquo;large language models.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> A paper from Stanford emphasizes applications: &ldquo;foundation models&rdquo; are those that can adapt &ldquo;to a wide range of downstream tasks.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Each name identifies a different feature of recent research as the one that matters. To keep that question open, I&rsquo;ll refer here to &ldquo;deep neural models of language,&rdquo; a looser category.</p>
<p>However we define them, neural models of language are already changing the way we search the web, write code, and even play games. Academics outside computer science urgently need to reflect on them. &ldquo;On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; deserves credit for starting that discussion &mdash; especially since its publication required tenacity and courage. I am honored to be part of a forum exploring its significance for the humanities.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    In historical disciplines, it is far from obvious that all meaning boils down to intentional communication between individuals.
</blockquote>
<p>The argument that Bender et al. advance has two parts: first, that large language models pose social risks, and second, that they will turn out to be a &ldquo;misdirected research effort&rdquo; anyway, since they pretend to perform &ldquo;natural language understanding&rdquo; but &ldquo;do not have access to meaning.&rdquo; (615).</p>
<p>I agree that the trajectory of recent research has risks. But to understand the risks language models pose, I think we will need to understand how they produce meaning. The premise that they simply &ldquo;do not have access to meaning&rdquo; tends to prevent us from seeing the models’ social role. I hope humanists can help illuminate that role by offering a wider range of ways to think about the work language does.</p>
<h2 id="language-models-as-models-of-culture">Language models as models of culture</h2>
<p>It is true that language models don&rsquo;t yet represent their own communicative goals or an interlocutor&rsquo;s state of mind. These are important aspects of language, and for &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots,&rdquo; they are the whole story: the article defines <em>meaning</em> as &ldquo;meaning conveyed between individuals&rdquo; and &ldquo;grounded in communicative intent&rdquo; (616).</p>
<p>But in historical disciplines, it is far from obvious that all meaning boils down to intentional communication between individuals. Historians often use <em>meaning</em> to describe something more collective, because the meaning of a literary work, for example, is not circumscribed by intent. It is common for debates about the meaning of a text to depend more on connections to books published a century earlier (or later) than on reconstructing the author&rsquo;s conscious plan.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I understand why researchers in a field named &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; would associate meaning with mental activity and see writing as a dubious proxy for it. But historical disciplines rarely have access to minds, or even living subjects. We work mostly with texts and other traces. For this reason, I&rsquo;m not troubled by the part of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; that warns about &ldquo;the human tendency to attribute meaning to text&rdquo; even when the text &ldquo;is not grounded in communicative intent&rdquo; (618, 616). Historians are already in the habit of finding meaning in genres, nursery rhymes, folktale motifs, ruins, political trends, and other patterns that never had a single author with a clear purpose.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> If we could find meaning only in intentional communication, we wouldn&rsquo;t find much meaning in the past at all. So not all historical researchers will be scandalized when we hear that a model is merely &ldquo;stitching together sequences of linguistic forms it has observed in its vast training data&rdquo; (617). That&rsquo;s what we often do too, and we could use help.</p>
<p>A willingness to find meaning in collective patterns may be especially necessary for disciplines that study the past. But this flexibility is not limited to scholars. The writers and artists who borrow language models for creative work likewise appreciate that their instructions to the model acquire meaning from a training corpus. The phrase &ldquo;Unreal Engine,&rdquo; for instance, encourages a neural network called <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">CLIP</a> to select pictures with a consistent, cartoonified style. But this has nothing to do with the dictionary definition of &ldquo;unreal.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just a helpful side-effect of the fact that many video game screenshots are captioned with the name of the game engine (Unreal Engine) that produced them.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Intelligence only starts to interest us after it mixes with time to become a biased, limited pattern of collective life.
</blockquote>
<p>In short, I think people who use neural models of language typically use them for a different purpose than &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; assumes. The immediate value of these models is often not to mimic individual language understanding, but to represent specific cultural practices (like styles or expository templates) so they can be studied and creatively remixed. This may be disappointing for disciplines that aspire to model general intelligence. But for historians and artists, cultural specificity is not disappointing. Intelligence only starts to interest us after it mixes with time to become a biased, limited pattern of collective life. Models of culture are exactly what we need.</p>
<h2 id="language-models-in-historical-research">Language models in historical research</h2>
<p>While I&rsquo;m skeptical that language models are devoid of meaning, I do share other concerns raised by the authors of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots.&rdquo; For instance, I agree that researchers will need a way to understand the subset of texts that shape a model&rsquo;s response to a given prompt. Culture is historically specific, so models will never be free of omission and bias. But by the same token, we need to know which practices they represent.</p>
<p>If companies want to offer language models as a service to the public &mdash; say, in web search &mdash; they will need to do even more than know what their models represent. Somehow, a single model will need to produce a picture of the world that is acceptable to a wide range of audiences, without amplifying harmful biases or filtering out minority discourses (Bender et al., &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots,&rdquo; 614). That&rsquo;s a delicate balancing act.</p>
<p>Historians don&rsquo;t have to compress their material as severely as that. Since history is notoriously a story of conflict, and our sources were interested participants, few people expect historians to represent all aspects of the past with one correctly balanced model. On the contrary, historical inquiry is usually about comparing perspectives. Machine learning is not the only way to do this, but it can help. For instance, researchers can measure differences of perspective by training multiple models on different publication venues or slices of the timeline.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>When research is organized by this sort of comparative purpose, the biases in data are not usually a reason to refrain from modeling &mdash; but a reason to create more corpora and train models that reflect a wider range of biases. On the other hand, training a variety of models becomes challenging when each job requires thousands of GPUs. Tech companies might have the resources to train many models at that scale. But will universities?</p>
<p>One way around this impasse is to train a single model that can explicitly distinguish multiple perspectives. At present, researchers create this flexibility in a rough and ready way by &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; BERT on different samples. A more principled approach might design models to recognize the social structure in their original training data. One recent paper associates each text with a date stamp, for instance, to train models that respond differently to questions about different years.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Similar approaches might produce models explicitly conditioned on variables like venue or nationality &mdash; models that could associate each statement or prediction they make with a social vantage point. Producing models that can represent hundreds of vantage points may become easier if this technology evolves &mdash; as increasingly seems likely &mdash; to separate the language model proper from a larger database that explicitly encodes world knowledge.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Training a new language model is computationally expensive. But editing the knowledge base to reflect a particular period or set of sources might be relatively cheap.</p>

    Neural models more closely resemble movable type: they will change the way culture is transmitted in many social contexts.
</blockquote>
<p>If neural language models are to play a constructive role in research, universities will also need alternatives to material dependence on tech giants. In 2020, it seemed that only the largest corporations could deploy enough silicon to move this field forward. In October 2021, things are starting to look less dire. Coalitions like EleutherAI are reverse-engineering language models.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Smaller corporations like Hugging Face are helping to cover underrepresented languages. NSF is proposing new computing resources.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The danger of oligopoly is by no means behind us, but we can at least begin to see how scholars might train models that represent a wider range of perspectives.</p>
<h2 id="the-effects-of-modeling-culture">The effects of modeling culture</h2>
<p>Of course, scholars are not the only people who matter. What will language models (and models of culture) mean for people outside universities?</p>
<p>I agree with the authors of &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; that neural language models are dangerous. But I am not sure that critical discourse has alerted us to the most important dangers yet. Critics often prefer to say that these models are dangerous only because they don&rsquo;t work and are devoid of meaning. Perhaps that seems to be the strongest rhetorical position, since it concedes no value to the models. But I suspect this hard line also prevents critics from envisioning what the models might be good for and how they&rsquo;re likely to be (mis)used.</p>
<p>Consider the surprising art scene that sprang up when CLIP was released. OpenAI still hasn&rsquo;t released the DALL-E model that uses the numbers CLIP assigns to text to find a corresponding point in a latent space of hypothetical images.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> But that didn&rsquo;t stop graduate students and interested amateurs from duct-taping CLIP to various generative image models and using the contraption to explore visual culture in dizzying ways.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Does the emergence of this subculture make any sense if we assume that CLIP is just a failed attempt to reproduce individual language use? In practice, the people tinkering with CLIP don&rsquo;t expect it to respond like a human reader. More to the point, they don&rsquo;t want it to. They&rsquo;re fascinated because CLIP uses language <em>differently</em> than a human individual would &mdash; mashing together the senses and overtones of words and refracting them into the potential space of internet images like a new kind of synesthesia.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The pictures produced are fascinating, but (at least for now) too glitchy to impress most people as art.

<p>Will models of this kind also have negative effects? Absolutely. The common observation that they could reinforce existing biases is the mildest possible example. If we approach neural models as machines for mapping and rewiring collective behavior, we will quickly see that they could do much worse than reinforce existing biases: for instance, deepfakes could create new hermetically sealed subcultures and beliefs that are difficult to contest.</p>
<p>My goal in this essay is not to decide whether neural language models are good or bad &mdash; just to clarify what&rsquo;s being modeled, why people care, and what kinds of (good or bad) effects we might expect. Reaching a comprehensive judgment is likely to take decades. After all, models are easy to distribute. So this was never a problem, like gene splicing, that could stay bottled up as an ethical dilemma for one profession that controlled the tools. Neural models more closely resemble movable type: they will change the way culture is transmitted in many social contexts. Since the consequences of movable type included centuries of religious war in Europe, my analogy is not meant to reassure. I just mean that questions on this scale don&rsquo;t get resolved quickly or by experts. We are headed rather for a broadly political debate about antitrust, renewable energy, and the shape of human culture itself &mdash; a debate where everyone will have some claim to expertise.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>Let me end, however, on a positive note. I have suggested that approaching neural models as models of culture rather than intelligence gives us even more reason to worry about them. But it also gives us more reason to hope. It is not entirely clear what we plan to gain by modeling intelligence, since there are already more than seven billion intelligences on the planet. By contrast, it is easy to see how exploring spaces of possibility implied by the past of human culture could support a more reflective and more adventurous approach to our future. I can imagine a world where generative models of culture are used grotesquely or locked down as IP for Netflix. But I can also imagine a world where fan communities use them to remix plot tropes and gender norms, making &ldquo;mass culture&rdquo; a more self-conscious, various, and participatory phenomenon than the twentieth century usually allowed it to become.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which of those worlds we will build. But either way, I suspect we will need to reframe our conversation about artificial intelligence as a conversation about models of culture and the latent spaces they imply. Philosophers and science fiction writers may enjoy debating whether software can have mental attributes like intention. But that old argument does little to illuminate the social questions new technologies are really raising. Neural language models are dangerous and fascinating because they can illuminate and transform shared patterns of behavior &mdash; in other words, cultural practices. When the problem is redescribed this way, the concerns about equity foregrounded by &ldquo;Stochastic Parrots&rdquo; still matter deeply. But the imagined contrast between mimicry and meaning in the article&rsquo;s title no longer connects with any satirical target. Culture clearly has meaning. But I&rsquo;m not sure that anyone cares whether a culture has autonomous intent, or whether it is merely parroting human action.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t said much about the energy cost of training models. For one thing, I&rsquo;m not fully informed about contemporary efforts to keep that cost low. More importantly, I think the cause of carbon reduction is actively harmed by pitting different end users against each other.

A Parrot Called MarIA</h2>
<p>Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world as a mother tongue. Official reports, survey-based studies, and Wikipedia confirm it. And Google can predict it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The data speaks for itself: there are more than twenty countries where Spanish is the official language. At United States universities, Spanish is the most popular second language choice, and there are twenty-three Academies of the Spanish Language &mdash; Academias de la Lengua Española &mdash; all over the world.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> But Spanish has been losing the geopolitical and symbolic battle against English as the language of science since the last century, and few technological developments have helped to improve this situation.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, global research on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has grown exponentially, offering computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) a place of relevance in the academic curriculum of different disciplines and fields, such as digital humanities. Nonetheless, the North-South imbalance in this field is evident. Most NLP research is still primarily done in English, and it takes a lot of time to make these resources available in Spanish. Even if they do become available, it is often via multilingual versions that are not as accurate as the English alternative.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    The so-called Global South is suspicious of technology, as an uncomfortable consumer of foreign Northern developments.
</blockquote>
<p>Among Spanish-speaking countries, Spain has been taking the lead in AI and NLP research with official initiatives like <a href="https://datos.gob.es/en/report"><em>Aporta</em></a>, published in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation&rsquo;s portal, and their project, &ldquo;Tecnologías emergentes y datos abiertos: Inteligencia Artificial.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Although the Spanish initiative is welcome and reflects a sustained human and technological work, it takes an absolutely technopositivist approach. There is not much critical reflection on the dangers or limitations in the use of open public data to develop and exploit language models, and nothing is said, for instance, about the rare-earth technologies that are part of a strategic industry and a geopolitical asset that only a few countries in the world take profit from.</p>
<p>Last July, the Iberian country unveiled the first major project on language and AI from the National Library of Spain (Biblioteca Nacional de España — BNE). MarIA is the first massive AI model of the Spanish language. MarIA, a RoBERTa model, was born from a large amount of data that the BNE ingested in the MareNostrum supercomputer of the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre. MarIA&rsquo;s data are the files in WARC format resulting from the tracking and archiving of the Spanish website, which, by law, the BNE scrapes and preserves.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about numbers: 59 terabytes of the BNE web archive and 6,910,000 hours of the MareNostrum supercomputer were used to build, curate, and compile this corpus. As a result, 201,080,084 clean and duplicate-free documents were obtained, occupying a total of 570 gigabytes. The second step of the training, based on neural network technology, required 184,000 processor hours and more than 18,000 GPU hours.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> According to the paper published a few months ago, the released models &mdash; between 125 million and 355 million parameters respectively &mdash; will be expanded using new and different sources, such as scientific publications of the Spanish Higher Council for Scientific Research (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas — CSIC) and the Spanish Wikipedia.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> There are also plans to start training models for other Romance languages ​​like Catalan, Galician, Basque, and Portuguese and for much more complex varieties of Spanish, such as what is usually termed Latin American Spanish or <em>español de América</em>.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the so-called Global South is suspicious of technology, as an uncomfortable consumer of foreign Northern developments and as a receiver of critiques from the big nations.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> A primary example is the accusation that Southern nations do little to reduce environmental damage by perpetuating the use of old technologies, a charge that distracts from discussions on the ways that new bitcoin, blockchain, and AI industries are polluting and damaging the Global South.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>I must confess that my perspective on language models and AI is one of a Southern researcher who is quite suspicious both of MarIA&rsquo;s Spanish and its capabilities, especially when it adapts its performance, for instance, to the <em>rioplatense</em> Spanish in translation apps, subtitling, chatbots, and automatic language prediction or correction.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> I find this situation to be an example of what Thomas Hervé Mboa Nkoudou defines as the techno-utopian rhetoric that trumpets the benefits of technological innovations but, paradoxically, rarely refers to the risks or drawbacks associated with the adoption of socio-technical infrastructures.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>I am convinced that we need more MarIAs. Still, I think these MarIAs should be explained in an open research ecosystem if they really want to overcome the problems of techno-colonialism and become reusable, reproducible models in those more than twenty Spanish-speaking countries. I am not aware of the research performed by the BNE model in terms of linguistic, geographic, or racial bias, but I imagine that the Spanish Language Academies around the world should also take part in this project. When it comes to the release of a model to the Spanish-speaking world for mass adoption, openness and diversity should be mandatory.</p>
<h2 id="2-a-parrot-called-bertin">2. A Parrot called BERTIN</h2>
<p>The same week MarIA was widely announced in the media, BERTIN was born.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> The aim of this project was to pre-train a RoBERTa-base model from scratch using Common Crawl during the Flax/JAX Community Event, held July 7–14, 2021. I was impressed when, all of a sudden, there were two RoBERTa models available in Spanish. I decided to interview one of its mentors, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=31VBFVIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Javier de la Rosa</a>, a young and brilliant Spanish researcher and NLP expert. In the following section, part of the conversation we had is transcribed since it can help us reflect on how, why, and which language models are needed for the Spanish language.</p>
<h3 id="21-javier-bertin-and-gimena">2.1. Javier, BERTIN, and Gimena</h3>
<p><strong>Gimena (G):</strong> <em>BERTIN is proposed as a collaborative project. What role do humanists or linguists play (or could they play) in creating datasets and curating outputs?</em></p>
<p><strong>Javier (J):</strong> The creation of BERTIN has been community-oriented from its inception, made open by and for the community. Programmers, engineers, AI researchers, digital humanists, and computational linguists showed keen interest in taking part in BERTIN. Unfortunately, due to a purely practical matter (we only had funding and resources for ten days), not everyone was able to participate. However, we had very interesting and rich conversations about the orientation and goals of the project. In that sense, I think that one of the aspects both humanists and linguists could contribute to in these kinds of projects is the detection and documentation of bias. In our case, this issue emerged as an afterthought. As we analyzed the model, we realized that it preferred words from European or peninsular Spanish (&ldquo;coche&rdquo; vs &ldquo;auto&rdquo; vs &ldquo;carro&rdquo; ), and we understood that the model could suffer from certain geographic biases that had to be highlighted and corrected. Unfortunately, it is not easy to decrease bias after the model is trained. Nonetheless, team members with a linguistic background did a very good job documenting it.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Not all biases are bad. For example, one way to have a language model that is capable of understanding other varieties of Spanish could be skewing the dataset in order to magnify a less represented variety.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>G:</strong> <em>How should we create linguistic data or datasets in such a way that they do not perpetuate biases and hegemonic norms?</em></p>
<p><strong>J:</strong> At the moment, AI in general and language models in particular are very active fields. Toolkits are starting to analyze the data before the training begins, for example, to reduce certain known biases or to find patterns that could become problematic when exploiting the models. However, I must say that not all biases are bad. For example, one way to have a language model that is capable of understanding other varieties of Spanish could be skewing the dataset in order to magnify a less represented variety and produce a model capable of adapting better to diverse varieties.</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> <em>If you had to teach a course on data curation from a humanistic perspective, what methods or practices would you teach? Can we imagine a future where the humanities become important to data experts?</em></p>
<p>It is true that humanists have been curating data from time immemorial, but we are lagging behind and moving too slowly compared to the advances of technology and AI. That being said, there are initiatives to make these two worlds a bit more data-savvy. For example, <a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/">Thomas Padilla&rsquo;s Collections as Data project</a> has opened a new research line for institutions, especially libraries and archives. This can be seen in language models and other AI initiatives such as the one from the National Library of Norway, which used its digital collection to build a language model for Norwegian, including that of the BNE.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Therefore, I believe that if I had to teach data curation, I would do it from this hybrid perspective, pointing out the importance of preservation and the need to have data in formats that are not only interoperable but also (re)usable.</p>
<p><strong>G:</strong> <em>Do you see negative consequences of humanists relying on Google either to use or test their models? Is there a chance that we can develop open source resources for this kind of research? Should we continue to trust big tech companies with questionable ethical practices, or start developing smaller language models?</em></p>
<p>Business for large companies does not rely on software, but on hardware and infrastructure. Most of the advances in AI are developed using open technologies, and this is why it has progressed so fast during the last 10–15 years. Both the adoption of free software and the release of models and open source libraries are ways of inviting users to work on those platforms. For instance, if you want to train a model for Basque, you can do it in Google Cloud and then leave. But if Google provides you with the code and allows you to integrate it with its platform, and also teaches you how to apply it in thirty other languages, it saves you a lot of work. Of course, you can also try to train your model on a supercomputer like the MareNostrum that has been used for the BNE model, but access to these types of resources is not easy or direct. You could even buy 120 NVIDIA graphic cards and train them, but it is a material investment difficult to justify when there are on-demand solutions that assure an efficient use of money. What we have tried to show with BERTIN is that some costs can be reduced when training a model. We are still a long way from being able to train these massive models on our personal computers, but we must not stop making progress in this regard.</p>
<h2 id="3-some-reflections">3. Some reflections</h2>
<p>From my point of view, an important conclusion that emerges from the BERTIN project is that, although we cannot escape the need for big data and big machines to produce language models with good performance, the expense of training them can be reduced in terms of time and data. That makes it possible for smaller teams to enter a domain that, for the moment, is the exclusive preserve of large Global Northern companies and institutions. It is also a proposal aware of the needs of a more open approach to research and of the environmental impacts of technology. Far from a techno-utopian perspective, BERTIN is not at war with companies or institutions and it is not aligned with open science activism. It somehow tries to take the best of both worlds. Possibly, this middle ground is where global Spanish AI and NLP projects could take place in the future years.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Language models . . . can help generate automated text summaries, find similarities in textual collections, classify works based on theme, genre, or content, and link data based only on information contained in a text.
</blockquote>
<p>Although the field of AI goes beyond the horizon of humanistic work, it is evident that language models have many applications with an immediate impact on the humanities and digital humanities. They can improve the outputs of systems for optical character recognition (OCR), stylometry, and authorial attribution. They can help generate automated text summaries, find similarities in textual collections, classify works based on theme, genre, or content, link data based only on information contained in a text, etc. Still, it is important to note that the outputs of these systems must also be subjected to study and criticism, aligning, in this way, with open science initiatives. In this regard, another project by Javier De la Rosa I would like to refer to is ALBERTI, a BERT-based multilingual model for poetry. ALBERTI is capable of completing poems automatically. But in a second stage, humans evaluate and determine which ALBERTI substitutions could be considered more poetic.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> It&rsquo;s a good example of how all models must be evaluated and limited by humans, not only in the humanities but in everyday life. As the proverb goes, &ldquo;Quien mucho habla, mucho yerra&rdquo; (&ldquo;He who speaks too much, makes many mistakes&rdquo;), which seems true both for humans and machines.</p>

Klein use the example of the proliferation of street signs to make a point about making: <em>“One does not need street names for navigation until one has strangers in the landscape</em>” (italics in the original).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> In D’Ignazio and Klein’s usage, the “strangers” here are data scientists, digging through data with which they are not intimately familiar. In this piece, we use our experience as platform maintainers to illustrate how all collaborators and participants are “strangers” at one point or another in the process of research development;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> it is only through collective building that we can successfully name our streets.</p>
<p>The framework for our discussion will be <a href="https://www.scribesofthecairogeniza.org"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em></a>, a crowdsourcing project hosted on the Zooniverse platform.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <em>Scribes</em> invites members of the public to engage deeply with the Cairo Geniza corpus: hundreds of thousands of manuscript fragments written in Hebrew and Arabic script, found in an Egyptian synagogue and dating mostly from the tenth to thirteenth centuries CE.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> The project is a collaboration between the Zooniverse team and a group of specialists from the Judaica Digital Humanities program at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries (as well as a consortium of partner institutions).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Though a collaborative effort, each of the lead institutions brought their own goals to this project.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> For the Penn team, the original goal was to fully digitize the Geniza corpus through transcription of the fragment texts by a nonspecialist audience. The Zooniverse team came to the <em>Scribes</em> partnership as part of a larger research and development effort, “Transforming Libraries and Archives through Crowdsourcing,” which aimed to expand the resources available on the Zooniverse platform to better support galleries, libraries, archives, and museums in their efforts to create and run crowdsourcing projects.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>This piece will trace the history of this partnership, focusing on the interplay between often-competing elements of Digital Humanities (henceforth DH) collaboration: optimization and engagement, experience and outcome. In our attempts to balance the demands of infrastructure against the practice of paleography, what can we, as collaborators, learn about the process?</p>
<p>Throughout the piece, we have provided interludes in which we will walk you through the process of creating clickable keyboards for transcribing Hebrew script. Please feel free to interact with the example keyboards. You can try the full version by visiting <a href="https://www.scribesofthecairogeniza.org"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em></a> and choosing the Easy Hebrew transcription workflow.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> You can read the interludes in their entirety and view the source code on <a href="https://shaunanoordin.github.io/zooniverse-startwords/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Everything we build from this point onwards is meant to solve one very simple problem: <strong>how do we allow users to type, into that text input field, in a language that&rsquo;s not native to their keyboard?</strong> For example, how do we help a user type in the text &ldquo;ごはんを食べる&rdquo; when they only have a US-International QWERTY keyboard, and we don’t want to ask them to futz about in their computer settings to install a Japanese language pack?</p>

<h2 id="communal-making-and-collective-building">Communal Making and Collective Building</h2>
<p>When we build public crowdsourcing projects, the work we do as platform builders/maintainers is intended to facilitate research goals without sacrificing the experience of the people who will be engaging with what we build. This means taking the ideas our collaborators bring to the table (“What do you want to do with this project?”) and creating tools and interfaces that support their needs (“What do we need to build/adapt to facilitate the realization of these goals?”) while simultaneously supporting public audiences by allowing them to engage with the project content with no assumption of previously-held knowledge (“How do we need to adjust these goals—and, by extension, the supporting tools/infrastructure—to make this project inclusive of a broad, public audience?”).</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    …bridging concepts as varied as paleography and pull requests requires time and patience
</blockquote>
<p>Bill Endres writes that “building faces the challenge of not being writing.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> For Endres, “building” is a practice typically excluded from institutional decisions on tenure and promotion in humanities departments. Much of the discourse around building in DH acknowledges this disparate treatment between the creation of tools and the production of traditional research, but Endres’s phrase also reminds us that writing is the medium by and around which scholarly communication has also primarily taken place. We write, we peer review, we give written feedback. When we talk about the Things We Are Building, the role of translator or mediator is often assumed by team members who have spent time in both “worlds.” Learning how to communicate across varying disciplinary backgrounds or via unfamiliar mediums (in our case, bridging concepts as varied as paleography and pull requests) requires time and patience.</p>

<h3 id="02-a-simple-on-screen-keyboard">02. A Simple On-screen Keyboard</h3>
<p>A straightforward solution is to create an on-screen keyboard for the user. In this example, we create a Japanese keyboard with 5 characters. Clicking on each button/“keyboard key” adds the corresponding character to the end of the text input field.</p>
<p><em>Note: we’re using the Japanese hiragana characters あいうえお here because they map easily to the English characters AIUEO, and are written left to right. We’ll build up to more complex alphabets, such as Hebrew and its right-to-left layout, in later sections.</em></p>

<p>The code here is simple, but we already come across a problem: what if the user wants to add a Japanese character in the middle (instead of at the end) of the text box? This is, after all, a very basic function for a normal text box—you can place the text cursor/caret at any part of the existing text and then start typing.</p>

</div>
<p>It can help to identify shared frames of reference early in the collaboration. The original proposal for the project that would become <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> envisioned a public transcription effort that would teach volunteers “without any prerequisite knowledge” how to transcribe the Arabic and Hebrew scripts found in the Geniza. It cited a previous Zooniverse project, <a href="https://www.ancientlives.org"><em>Ancient Lives</em></a> (2011),<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> which featured a clickable keyboard that allowed users to transcribe ancient Greek papyri from the <a href="https://www.classics.ox.ac.uk/oxyrhynchus-papyri">Oxyrhynchus Collection</a> at the University of Oxford&rsquo;s Sackler Library through the process of character matching. <em>Ancient Lives</em> became an important reference for the entire Geniza project team because it allowed a group of people with a variety of professional backgrounds to engage in referential communication around a shared goal, rather than fumbling together toward an abstract concept. Starting with a critique of an existing resource allowed us to determine the features that were applicable for the context in which we were working—what we wanted to recreate (or revamp) as well as what components were missing that would be key to working with Geniza fragments.</p>
<p>To approach the transcription of a large, multilingual corpus by a nonspecialist audience, we needed to think about scaffolding. We began by considering the goals, translating those goals into actionable tasks, then breaking those tasks down to their very smallest unit. This is particularly useful from a project management perspective, where it’s necessary to get a sense of the total effort required—no matter how small the task—to see what can realistically be completed within the available time frame. Additionally, this process can help identify potential conflict in the design and development stages. There will often be overlap in the translation from goals into tasks: the goal of transcribing the Geniza corpus and the goal of making the project accessible by a public, nonspecialist audience are not separate things; indeed, each will significantly impact how the other is carried out. Breaking down the goals helps to identify the places where that overlap will create tension in the work.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Of those in our audience who could read Arabic and/or Hebrew, a significant subset would not have experience reading or transcribing Aramaic, Judeo-Persian, or any of the other languages known to be found among the Geniza fragments.
</blockquote>
<p>During the brainstorming process for <em>Scribes</em>, we discussed how the <em>Ancient Lives</em> approach (presenting users with a clickable keyboard to use while transcribing) was desirable because it provides support for audiences who don’t use an Arabic or Hebrew keyboard at home and may not be familiar with each script’s characters. We know through Google Analytics and user surveys that the majority of registered Zooniverse volunteers are from the United States and the United Kingdom. As a result, we could safely assume that a significant portion of our audience would use an English-language keyboard, and a significant subset would not be able to read Arabic and/or Hebrew. Of those in our audience who <em>could</em> read Arabic and/or Hebrew, a significant subset would not have experience reading or transcribing Aramaic, Judeo-Persian, or any of the other languages known to be found among the Geniza fragments.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> While clickable keyboards would help with the specific task of transcription within the overall project workflow, we also knew a translatable interface would be necessary to support a multilingual community of volunteers. So we decided early on that the entire project would need to be available in Arabic, English, and Hebrew, adding an additional layer of complexity to the design and development process in order to support right-to-left (RTL) as well as left-to-right (LTR) text.</p>
<div class="interlude">
<h3 id="03-text-selection">03. Text Selection</h3>
<p>This is actually a solved problem: we use the standard <code>HTMLInputElement</code>’s <code>selectionStart</code>, <code>selectionEnd</code>, and <code>setSelectionRange</code> to interact with the “text cursor” on the text input field.</p>

<p>In the example above, we’ve done two things in the code: 1. we ensure the Japanese characters are inserted at the position of the text cursor/caret, and 2. we ensure the text input maintains focus after the insertion. These may seem like minor coding considerations, but they’re important to <strong>ensure a consistent User Experience (UX), since users often have pre-set expectations on how User Interface (UI) elements should behave.</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Based on institutional knowledge—held by our Zooniverse colleagues who built the <em>Ancient Lives</em> project—and early technical experiments, we knew that a basic version of the clickable keyboard feature would be technically feasible to create. However, the breadth of scripts, languages, layouts, and physical deterioration among the vast Geniza corpus meant that there would be varying levels of difficulty in the fragments’ transcription. To be immediately presented with a random Geniza fragment and asked to transcribe it would be overwhelming for most users. To that end, we considered ways to harness existing information about the fragments (metadata) to break down the corpus into smaller groups. The problem with this approach was that the fragments came from multiple institutions, each with its own metadata system. Some of those systems were more robust (and more recently updated) than others.</p>
<p>The team agreed that this method would be helpful in creating pathways for participation for nonspecialists, but we were concerned that not all of the datasets we were working with had robust, reliable metadata. What was the taxonomy we were hoping to draw on—an existing framework for classifying fragments? A new one? How would we apply consistent metadata to so many fragments within a limited amount of time? <em>Is this something that the project volunteers could help with?</em></p>
<p>Once we determined that metadata enhancement could be its own crowdsourced task, we considered how to add that task to the project in a meaningful way.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> We wanted to make transcription accessible. But we also wondered: Could the <em>classification</em> of fragments proceed in a way that did not require previous knowledge of the materials? Would it be interesting for our audience? How would they benefit from taking part?</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Could the classification of fragments proceed in a way that did not require previous knowledge of the materials?
</blockquote>
<p>To break down the necessary metadata fields into accessible tasks, we decided to map our desired classification types onto easily identifiable visual characteristics.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The Geniza experts determined several pieces of information they might ask for at the pre-transcription stage, and were then challenged to teach the team members who weren’t familiar with the Geniza—or even manuscript studies in the broader sense—how to recognize these features when viewing a fragment. For example, in order to ask users whether a fragment was written in Hebrew script or Arabic script (or both), the content experts needed to determine what information is necessary to successfully answer the question.</p>

<p>Alright, so we now have an on-screen keyboard. But what about the user’s physical keyboard? A user might find it easier to use their physical keyboard to do text transcription, compared to clicking each on-screen keyboard button individually. With that in mind, let’s try to translate those physical key presses into our custom character input.</p>
<p>In this example, when the user presses the &ldquo;A&rdquo; key on their keyboard, the Japanese character あ is inserted into the text field instead. Same for the other characters: A -&gt; あ , I -&gt; い, U -&gt; う, E -&gt; え, O -&gt; お</p>

<p><em>If you have an on-screen keyboard AND you&rsquo;re capturing physical key input, it’s a good idea to label those on-screen keyboard buttons with the corresponding physical keys.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest considerations here is <strong>what kind of physical keyboard does your user have?</strong> In our examples, we’re making a very hard assumption that all our users have US-International QWERTY keyboards, and we choose to map <em>physical keyboard keys</em> to their replacement characters.</p>
<p><em>Note: there are different ways to get what the user typed into a text field. keyboardEvent.code corresponds to the PHYSICAL key on the keyboard. keyboardEvent.key corresponds to the TEXT VALUE of the key. If a user presses the “A” key on a US-International QWERTY keyboard, we get code=‘KeyA,’ and key=‘a’ (if shift and caps lock are off) or key=‘A’ (if shift and caps lock are on).</em></p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Now that we know how to capture and replace keyboard input, we also need to learn when not to do so. Sometimes, when a user presses the “A” key, they just want to type in the character “A,” not “あ”! <strong>Always allow your users the option to disable your on-screen keyboard.</strong> The example above has no such option, but we&rsquo;ll explore how we can do this once we jump into the “multi-language” functionality of our onscreen keyboard.</p>

</div>
<p>This was a turning point in the collaboration, as we began to understand the real value of having multiple kinds of “strangers” and their perspectives in the room. Speaking to diverse perspectives—even within our planning meetings—prevented us from sharing ideas and information without considering how those concepts might be broken down into simpler components. Rather than being a barrier to communication, it gave us the opportunity to observe a version of the volunteer experience we were building in real time, through our interactions with one another.</p>
<h2 id="designing-scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza-for-public-access">Designing Scribes of the Cairo Geniza for Public Access</h2>
<p>As the content specialists solidified their goals and worked with our team to determine the best way to accomplish those goals, two design needs became clear: first, that we could utilize existing Zooniverse project builder infrastructures to make a pre-transcription task that would produce useful metadata; and second, that a custom transcription interface would be necessary to support the on-screen keyboards.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    User experience (UX) design relies on common behavioral patterns to help a user feel comfortable in an interface, even when faced with a completely novel situation
</blockquote>
<p>We didn’t need to start from scratch. <em>Ancient Lives</em> provided a shared reference on which to build. Which parts of that interface were successful? What made the use cases in <em>Scribes</em> unique and therefore required a rethinking of the user experience? What other transcription projects existed online that could provide inspiration for our task? These questions helped shape initial design sketches for the transcription workflow and text input area.</p>

<p>User experience (UX) design relies on common behavioral patterns to help a user feel comfortable in an interface, even when faced with a completely novel situation (such as transcribing an ancient manuscript written in an unfamiliar language). UX designers also rely heavily on direct user feedback to ensure that the interface both functions as it should and feels natural to those users. To that end, we first identified a few key groups of user personas to envision our target audience. These personas served as guides throughout the design process. Would a grad student in Massachusetts be able to quickly understand how to transcribe a line of text? Would a pensioner in Brighton? What about a modern native speaker? By keeping in mind these different experience levels, we were able to focus our design efforts and keep scope creep to a minimum.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="05-code-cleanup">05. Code Cleanup</h3>
<p>Before we proceed with the advanced considerations of creating an on-screen keyboard with multiple languages, let’s clean up our code.</p>
<p>In the example below, you won’t see many changes in terms of UI functionality, but a lot of the source code was altered. Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Japanese characters have now been compiled into a “Japanese keyboard” data object, setting the stage for <strong>dynamically generated keyboards</strong> for different languages.</li>
<li>Similarly, we now have “English keyboard” and “QWERTY layout” data objects that help ensure <strong>the visual layout of the on-screen keyboard matches the user’s physical keyboard.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As we worked through the design, it was essential that we also speak to real users of the platform in order to validate our assumptions and test that the task we were designing was easy to understand. We reached out to our list of Zooniverse beta reviewers as well as personal networks to find native Hebrew and Arabic speakers who were willing to test the platform in translation. Through these conversations, we were able to see how a RTL interface would differ from English or other LTR language interfaces, and make adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>We also realized that because the subject matter could be intimidating, it was important to craft an interface that would straddle the line between friendly and knowledgeable. This was accomplished through the use of typography and color. First, we looked for a typeface that could be both friendly and trustworthy: both are attributes of a family of sans-serifs called Grotesque. These simple, clean typefaces are easy to read and add a friendly personality to the interface.</p>

<p>It was also important that the experience remain similar across all three languages, so typefaces were chosen and vetted with native speakers to ensure parity.</p>

<p>Now that we have cleaned up the code so that the English and Japanese keyboards are stored data objects, we see that it’s very simple to add new languages/keyboards to the system, and to allow the user to switch between those languages/keyboards.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, we’ve added a joke &ldquo;Emoji keyboard&rdquo; that maps QWERTY keys to arbitrary emoji characters. Typing in “Hello world” into input text field will result in the emoji “text” of “🐟🤣🦋🦋😍 😅😍🥰🦋🐒.”</p>

<p><em>Note: there is an option to select “(No keyboard)” here, which disables the on-screen keyboard as well as key capture. As mentioned earlier, <strong>always allow your users the option to disable your on-screen keyboard.</strong></em></p>
<p>At this point, you might realize one limitation to our solution: our code simply re-maps the QWERTY keyboard, so we can only have one character for one key.</p>
<p>While we started our examples with a very simple five-character Japanese keyboard, we unfortunately have to discard it since a proper, fully functional Japanese keyboard is beyond the scope of this work. The Japanese <em>hiragana</em> writing system alone has 48 common base characters, which can be further modified with diacritics, character size, etc.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll start adding a Hebrew keyboard. The Hebrew alphabet has 22 characters, which will map very easily to English/QWERTY’s 26 characters. However, the Hebrew alphabet will introduce a new wrinkle: <strong>right-to-left text</strong>, which we’ll need to solve.</p>

</div>
<p>After the typography was chosen, we created a color palette that was inspired by the Geniza fragments themselves. A contrasting purple was chosen for the background to allow the subjects to visually pop. Even the help text was closely considered: because of the wide reach of the project, help text needed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Our baseline was a fifth-grade reading level using the Flesch-Kincaid scale.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>While most of the design used common user-interface patterns—a toolbar, iconography, other resources familiar to Zooniverse volunteers—the project goals called for the creation of a few novel or less frequently seen elements. These included the transcription mechanism itself and the interactive, on-screen keyboards.</p>
<p>In order to create useful transcription data, the team needed to ensure consistent line placement that an algorithm would be able to parse correctly.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> We looked both within and outside of Zooniverse for inspiration and found a variety of transcription methods, from single- to multi-track. We considered what to use as the basic unit of transcription: how would we ask users to break down the text on the page, e.g. by character, word, line? From our experience with other crowdsourced transcription projects, we knew that line-by-line transcription would be the optimal blend of user effort to manageable data output. And from testing, we found that it was most intuitive to click once at the start of a line and then again at the end of the line. From there, the project tutorial as well as pop-up directions guided the user through the transcription process and the use of the on-screen clickable keyboards.</p>
<div class="interlude">
<h3 id="07-hebrew-and-right-to-left-languages">07. Hebrew and Right-to-Left languages</h3>
<p>With the given assumption that English is the “default” language of web code (yes, we know, that discussion is a can of worms), it’s unsurprising that that layout of most web pages default to left-to-right (LTR), top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>As a result, we must be conscientious when we create on-screen keyboards for languages to read right-to-left (RTL), such as Hebrew and Arabic. In the example below, we’ve done two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve upgraded the keyboard data objects so each language, in addition to having characters, also has an <strong>explicit “direction” value.</strong> (Either “ltr” or “rtl”)</li>
<li>The text input field has an explicit CSS direction value that changes depending on the active keyboard.</li>

<p>Since we’re only interested in creating a functional on-screen keyboard, we only modified the CSS direction of the text input field. On the other hand, if you’re creating, for example, a whole website that supports both LTR and RTL languages, then you need to be conscientious about the layout of your entire website, and whether that layout needs to be flipped along the horizontal axis to make sense to RTL readers.</p>
<p><em>Fun(?) Note: mixing LTR text with RTL text can lead to extremely confusing UI interactions. For example, in the text input field below, using your mouse, try to highlight the word APPLE plus one character before it and one character after it, i.e. &ldquo;הAPPLEן&rdquo;. Good luck!</em></p>

<h3 id="creating-clickable-keyboards">Creating clickable keyboards</h3>
<p>With the basic functionality of the clickable keyboards in place, we wanted to consider how we might further expand this resource for the context of <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em>. To support volunteers in the paleographic elements of transcribing Geniza fragments written in Hebrew script (again, the vast majority of the corpus), Penn team member Laura Newman Eckstein created a series of twenty script-based Hebrew “Alephbets” to be used as interchangeable skins on the clickable keyboard, to complement the modern Hebrew keyboard modeled after the <em>Ancient Lives</em> approach.</p>

<p>Because of the variation in the way that individual characters are composed across the variety of hands in the Geniza, these skins are essential to helping nonexpert transcribers feel more confident submitting a transcription. Users can view alternate ways of writing a particular character, and choose the keyboard that most closely matches the script type of the fragment they’re currently transcribing. The option to return to modern characters is always available, too.</p>

<p>This resource not only boosts confidence for transcribers, it also allows them to engage with paleographic concepts in a way that meets them at their level, whatever that may be. Users can look at the full list of scripts available and learn how to distinguish between square, cursive, and minuscule scripts. They can learn the names of Hebrew characters. Regional variations on scripts may inspire transcribers to think more closely about how or why writing might differ across physical space. This resource allows people to engage deeply with primary source materials without judging their level of expertise. It tells them it’s okay to be wrong. It invites participants in and encourages budding curiosity to bloom.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve proven that it’s possible to map different key input to characters from different languages, we need to solve another problem. Our users will be looking at <strong>handwritten manuscripts</strong> from different regions and different eras, so it’ll be very useful if they can have a <strong>visual reference</strong> for the different kind of <strong>scripts (handwritten text)</strong> available.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is a fairly straightforward matter of adding images—for each character, from various scripts—to our visual keyboard.</p>
<p>In our example below, we’ve added the “Yemenite Square” visual script reference for the Hebrew keyboard.</p>

<p>The actual hard work comes in two parts. First, it requires a human hand to create the reference image JPEG for each style of script, and to ensure it has a consistent layout. Second, there&rsquo;s a one-off upfront development cost to map the visuals to the data. We found that this early investment is well worth it when we get into the next section.</p>
<p><em>For our project, we decided to put every character of the “Yemenite Square” Hebrew script into a single image file (i.e. as opposed to having dozens of image files, one for each character) and used a CSS technique called “image sprites” to separate each character when needed. For example, when we want to show the ‘Alef’ א character (top row, right-most column) we tell the code to “crop” the image at x=440px y=0px width=50px height=50px.</em></p>

<h2 id="research-development-and-volunteer-advocacy">Research Development and Volunteer Advocacy</h2>
<p>The process of designing and building <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> required a deeply human-centered approach to ensure we could meet the original project goals of transcribing the Geniza corpus and providing a space for anyone to engage with Geniza materials, no matter their level of expertise. To achieve this, we considered the range of experience our users might have, and included scaffolding in the project to ensure that there were multiple pathways to participation (e.g. the Sorting workflow, transcription with aid from on-screen keyboards).</p>
<p>In this essay, we’ve discussed the interpersonal challenges of collaborating across disciplines, and the technical challenges of designing and building resources for a range of users. The final piece to discuss is the challenge of balancing engagement and outcome—in particular, identifying where the opportunities exist in this process to advocate for a positive user experience from our positions of power as builders and project leads, and considering what sort of impact that advocacy can have on the project’s outcomes.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Crowdsourcing is never a case of building a project and letting volunteers come to you. Scribes has succeeded in attracting a broad volunteer base because we built the project intentionally, with them in mind.
</blockquote>
<p>Whether we’re discussing workflows, networks of communication, data pipelines, or design processes, the individual components of public crowdsourcing projects cannot exist independently from the project as a whole. We don’t think about design as separate from data, because these pieces are inextricably linked; project data influences design, which then impacts data output. Every decision we make during the design phase will impact various other pieces of a project beyond those directly affected in that moment. Choosing to build for a broad audience instead of restricting the project to those with previous experience will have an impact on the results. It will also increase the amount of labor involved in creating the project.</p>

<h3 id="09-multiple-visual-script-references">09. Multiple Visual Script References</h3>
<p>There are several advantages to organising our &ldquo;Yemenite Square&rdquo; Hebrew script into a single image file. Smaller downloads for our users is one, but more importantly, its consistent visual layout allows us to use it as a template to quickly deploy <strong>multiple visual scripts.</strong></p>
<p>In the example below, you’ll see that we’ve added <strong>six new Hebrew scripts,</strong> and if you check the code, doing so only required six additional lines of code.</p>

<p>While it’s now trivial to add new scripts from a code perspective, please remember that it still takes a considerable amount of effort to create each individual script’s JPEG. (So developers, please remember to thank the people who’ve been scanning the manuscripts, manually identifying the handwritten characters, and putting them into a nice image file for us.)</p>
<p><em>Below, you can see three different Hebrew scripts that we used. You’ll note that while we made an effort to keep the visual layout, character position, and character size consistent across every style of script, some scripts are missing certain characters. For example, both Maghrebi Cursive and Byzantine Miniscule don’t have a visual reference for the “elongated Kaf” ך character. In these cases, we simply didn’t have a visual reference from the source.</em></p>

<p>In the case of <em>Scribes</em>, creating the Sorting workflow was not part of the original project goals. Including the workflow meant that there would be another large set of project results, in addition to the transcription data being generated, that the Penn team would need to manage. It also meant that our team would have to consider how best to move data from the Sorting workflow into the appropriate Transcription workflows based on how the data was classified. Yes, this choice has resulted in more work for all of us, but it is also by far the most popular workflow on the project, with more than 325,000 classifications generated since <em>Scribes</em> launched in August 2017.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    An early review of the Sorting workflow data showed that for a majority of the fragments, volunteers were in one hundred percent agreement about which category best represented the scripts being used in the fragment (Hebrew, Arabic, both, no text).
</blockquote>
<p>The Sorting workflow and the clickable keyboards are both examples of how creating projects that are truly catered to nonspecialists requires teams to actually include public engagement as a goal and priority, instead of allowing it to be a secondary outcome to data generation. This prioritization requires serious time and effort. In particular, it requires a rejection of the common narrative around crowdsourcing as being a way to save time and energy, or a good option for under-resourced institutions who don’t have staff time to process data. Crowdsourcing is never a case of building a project and letting volunteers come to you. <em>Scribes</em> has succeeded in attracting a broad volunteer base because we built the project intentionally, with them in mind.</p>
<p>Paleography and manuscript transcription have traditionally been the purview of specialists, only accessible to those with institutional access and the skills to be trusted with fragile physical resources. By opening up a complex task to a broad, nonspecialist audience through collaborative, human-centered design, <em>Scribes</em> says to the public, “We trust you, we appreciate your help, and we worked hard to create a space that will support you.” We ended up with a space that “strangers” to the field could explore without feeling lost.</p>
<p>And it worked. An early review of the Sorting workflow data showed that for a majority of the fragments, volunteers were in one hundred percent agreement about which category best represented the scripts being used in the fragment (Hebrew, Arabic, both, no text). As Penn team member Emily Esten notes in a blog post about these results, “That’s impressive, considering the range of expertise from our volunteer base. For volunteers who had no experience at all, this means your best guess contributed to the community of knowledge and was, more likely than not, in agreement with others.”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> For public crowdsourcing projects, this is the best possible outcome: useful results created by a community of volunteers who don’t feel like they need special credentials to take part, and who can then see their collective effort taking shape as a meaningful contribution to research. From “strangers in a landscape” to makers themselves.</p>

<h2 id="douglass-days-annual-celebrations-before-the-pandemic">Douglass Day’s annual celebrations before the pandemic</h2>
<p>In 2017 we began to hold an event celebrating Frederick Douglass’s chosen birthday of February 14. Our event invites people to help transcribe digitized collections of African American history and culture, and to host transcribe-a-thon parties with their friends, classmates, or colleagues. Thousands have participated over the years.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Each year, we listen to the melodies of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” and eat birthday cake. Our livestreamed broadcast and social media posts go out to thousands. We share photos on Twitter and Instagram of libraries, community centers, and churches where people transcribe shoulder to shoulder. At our local events, we enjoy seeing strangers chat about what they found or learned. Our events expand who gets to help preserve and commemorate Black history.</p>
<p>We started this event from scratch in 2017. By the time we held our events at Howard University in 2020, we felt like we’d attained some momentum with our team members at the University of Delaware, Princeton’s Center for Digital Humanities, and the Center for Black Digital Research at Pennsylvania State University.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="adjusting-during-the-covid-19-pandemic">Adjusting During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
<p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. We had lessons for building community from years past. Yet even though we had been livestreaming and tweeting since 2017, we had few models for building a virtual, distanced community. We spent months of difficult planning to adapt our previous model into a virtual format.</p>
<p>Crucially, we connected with Lauren Algee and Carlyn Osborn at <em><a href="https://crowd.loc.gov/">By the People</a></em>—a Library of Congress project—to feature their campaign transcribing the papers of Mary Church Terrell, a groundbreaking Black feminist educator, activist, intellectual, and writer.</p>
<p>In the end, we managed to hold an event in February 2021 that retained the best parts of our past celebrations through lots of perseverance and creativity.</p>
<p>This snippet serves as a reflection on that transition. We’re sharing our hard-won lessons to help any others who might face similar challenges while hosting virtual and accessible events that foster ethical communities.</p>
<h2 id="redefining-our-digital-connections">Redefining our (digital) connections</h2>
<p>One of our principles is to create communal spaces that engage Black communities in remembering Black history.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> As we struggled with the constraints of pandemic isolation, we saw opportunity in our collective digital shifts. Could we use this opportunity to reimagine how we connect with our diverse audiences, spread the word about our events, and adapt our previous community engagements?</p>
<p>This process of rethinking our outreach transformed our use of online communications (social media, newsletter, and tutorial videos). We found new ways to connect with our audiences using tools in novel ways.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-outreach">Transforming Outreach</h2>
<p>Launching our social media campaign early on helped attract attention to the event and prepare our audiences for the redesigned event. We also created new hashtags, such as our <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GreatDouglassDayBakeoff&amp;src=typed_query">#GreatDouglassDayBakeoff</a>.</p>

<p>Amid the pandemic, we recognized that not all of our participants used social media so we expanded our newsletter. Our response rate was higher than on social media. We sent out regular reminders and resources, including a consistent timeline, visual aesthetic, and recurring thematic framing.</p>
<p>Our newsletters provide links to resources on our website and YouTube page.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> While we made tutorial videos before the pandemic, we expanded them to reinforce our event’s virtual presence.

<h2 id="our-results">Our Results</h2>
<p>Making Douglass Day more accessible resulted in our largest Douglass Day audience ever. We had over 7,000 attendees, including K–12 teachers, students, professors, librarians, local organizers, graduate students, community groups, historic Black sororities, civic groups, and individual participants. It would not have been possible if we had not integrated the needs of our communities into our process of creating a virtual community. We will take these lessons to our future celebrations to expand the hybrid possibilities for developing our communities around these digital projects.

These efforts have been led by research groups and platform designers like <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a>, platform designers like <a href="https://fromthepage.com/">FromThePage</a>, <a href="https://omeka.org/">Omeka</a>, <a href="https://pybossa.com/">PYBOSSA </a>and <a href="https://scripto.org/">Scripto</a>, and cultural heritage institutions like the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a> (NARA) and <a href="https://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian Institution</a>. Volunteers help researchers, journalists, conservationists, cultural heritage practitioners, and one another to gather data that contributes to real research, original art, policy, community health, and more. In this essay, we will focus on cultural heritage crowdsourcing, and transcription projects in particular. Typically, these projects invite volunteers to transcribe handwritten or printed materials produced with ornate type or typewriter documents that—due to slight irregularities of the type, faint ink, or use of thin papers like onion skin—are not amenable to handwritten text recognition (HTR) or optical character recognition (OCR).</p>

<p>Crowdsourced transcription projects generally fall into one of two categories: those that are structured around a particular research problem or question, and those that gather data to enhance search and discovery of materials for open-ended and ongoing purposes. Whereas many researchers want to extract particular pieces of information from datasets, such as water salinity and temperature from old ships logs to feed data into climate change models (<a href="https://www.oldweather.org/"><em>Old Weather</em></a>), most cultural heritage crowdsourcing projects gather transcriptions of entire documents to support as-yet-unstipulated research purposes. Their goal is to create pathways for discovery in one or more content management systems (CMS), the catalogs and/or other platforms that make metadata and images of original materials discoverable.</p>
<p>Transcriptions that reproduce the text on the page (as opposed to select pieces of data) have a variety of applications across numerous disciplines, and also have the power to solve two common challenges for researchers and the librarians and archivists who support them: 1) transcriptions speed up discovery, and 2) transcriptions can (if presented properly online) increase accessibility for those who cannot read the original handwriting, including those who are Blind or cognitively impaired and use a screen reader. Before we delve into a few case studies of organizations that have used crowdsourcing methods to generate text transcriptions for these purposes, we want to emphasize that while researchers and archivists alike want to foster discovery and accessibility, the barriers to achieving these goals through crowdsourcing are complex and not yet widely discussed.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    it’s not right to invite people to help researchers and increase accessibility … if the resulting data aren’t made widely available
</blockquote>
<p>The number of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) institutions that have successfully integrated their crowdsourced transcription data into their core CMSs is far outweighed by those that have not yet found a workable solution, and many who have found solutions have used workarounds that are a stop-gap until better alternatives emerge. For example, a common workaround is to publish bulk data in an online repository on GitHub or a university library or research repository, while GLAM practitioners try to determine how to integrate data into their core CMS. Lucinda Blaser of Royal Museums Greenwich identified the absence of appropriate metadata fields in her institution’s CMS as a major barrier to integrating the <em>Old Weather</em> transcriptions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> She and her colleagues were eager to use the data, but the metadata field they hoped to use had a character limit set by the vendor. Anne Bowser et al. expose the absence of norms and ongoing funding for data integration across citizen science crowdsourcing domains more broadly (including transcription projects), and highlight the ethical problems of not releasing crowdsourced data. They aver, and we agree, that it’s not right to invite people to “help researchers,” “increase accessibility,” and achieve other goals if the resulting data aren’t made widely available, as well as understandable—meaning that the methods of collection are well described.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Ina-Maria Jansson and Chern Li Liew explore anxieties about crowdsourcing data quality among GLAM practitioners as well as members of the public, some of whom are anxious about whether crowdsourced data deserves a place in the authoritative record.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Jansson and Liew’s findings are particularly disturbing, because they reveal that many institutions are actively engaged in crowdsourcing but still deeply uncomfortable with their own stated aims. These institutions are thus unlikely to hold up their end of the bargain with volunteers—namely making the data that volunteers produce available for research and enabling access. More work is needed to address concerns about data quality. Current approaches include:</p>
<ol>
<li>overcoming barriers to data publication and integration when people can see examples from peer institutions or trusted sources, they are likely to be reassured;</li>
<li>data quality analysis studies that provide solid information about the transcription outcomes from different projects, and</li>
<li>real talk about the quality of other data that is already in the authoritative record. For example, Victoria Van Hyning and her teammates at the Library of Congress (LOC) frequently pointed out to colleagues that the Library already publishes low-quality OCR in the authoritative record (often provided by vendors as part of their digitization package), and that crowdsourced transcriptions are typically of a much higher quality than this OCR.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we can all more openly discuss and address these challenges and ways of meeting them, we will make better progress in supporting collections discovery and use, research, and novel applications of crowdsourced data.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    data management planning is a necessary part of crowdsourcing
</blockquote>
<p>Crowdsourcing platform designers Ben and Sara Brumfield are also drawing attention to these issues as they affect scholarly editors and cultural heritage practitioners, and are working on some new solutions to data unification, publication, and discovery. In a recorded talk to the International Interoperable Image Framework (IIIF) conference in 2021, they demonstrate how content from digital scholarly editions can move between multiple systems like Fedora or ContentDM to FromThePage, where the images are transcribed by volunteers and/or an editorial team, and then back to a scholarly editing platform such as Omeka-S, all with the help of IIIF-compliant metadata and images. They discuss how scholarly edition materials might then feed back into the original CMS via the same IIIF metadata, in order to enhance the materials and increase discovery on the host institution’s CMS. They conclude their piece by announcing work on a new feature that will “allow editors to export stand-alone web-pages for minimal computing needs and digital preservation” in cases where there isn’t an institutional CMS amenable to this kind of roundtripping of the data.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h3>
<p>The remainder of this essay offers three case studies of projects that showcase different successes and challenges in crowdsourced transcription data integration. Our early-stage research reveals that the challenges facing these projects are more widely shared by a range of crowdsourcing stakeholders, including platform designers, academics, cultural heritage practitioners and the vendors who create CMSs for cultural heritage organizations. Van Hyning was directly involved in each project. These case studies include <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/shakespeares-world"><em>Shakespeare’s World</em></a> (SW), which launched on the Zooniverse platform in 2015 and was sunset in 2019. It was a partnership between Zooniverse, the Folger Shakespeare Library and the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (OED). The <a href="https://crowd.loc.gov/"><em>By the People</em></a> project (BTP) was launched by the Library of Congress (LOC) on a bespoke platform called <a href="https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia">Concordia</a> in 2018, and the <em>David C. Driskell Papers Project</em> was created by Van Hyning, six MLIS students, and their colleagues at the <a href="https://driskellcenter.umd.edu/">David C. Driskell Center</a> at the University of Maryland on the FromThePage platform in 2020, and launched in 2021. All of these were produced by multidisciplinary teams involving cultural heritage practitioners such as archivists, metadata specialists, curators, and academics from STEM and/or humanities backgrounds. Some projects involved students, while others involved formal project managers, web developers and database engineers (system designers). The projects were built on three different crowdsourcing platforms, all of which are separate “pass-through” applications that are not directly connected to the relevant cultural heritage institution’s CMS. The datasets in each case require some dedicated effort to move the content out of the crowdsourcing platform and into the CMS to appear alongside the digital images of the original documents, and thus make them searchable down to the page level.</p>
<h2 id="shakespeares-world"><em>Shakespeare’s World</em></h2>
<p>In this case study we’ll outline some successes of <em>SW</em> before coming on to the challenges of data aggregation that arose on the Zooniverse side, and the data integration challenges that arose on the Folger side. The quality of the research and engagement outcomes are significant, and bring home the ways in which the <em>SW</em> team’s struggles with data wrangling curtailed our overall rate of discovery. However, the data challenges the team encountered, and the enormous efforts that collaborators have spent to address these (including major updates to the Zooniverse platform and the development of numerous codebases and processes to clean the data) are important research activities and outcomes in their own right.</p>
<p>The goals of <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> (<em>SW</em>) were to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage a broad volunteer base to transcribe digitized Folger manuscripts from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to make the manuscript contents amenable to full-text search;</li>
<li>Engage early modern literature and history scholars, especially those with strengths in women’s history, history of science, food, and medicine, with crowdsourcing as a means to help them identify new materials for their research;</li>
<li>Identify previously unrecorded words, variants, and older usages of words for the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> (<em>OED</em>), and</li>
<li>Try out new approaches to transcription on the Zooniverse platform.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project achieved these goals to varying degrees. It exceeded our expectations in terms of engagement, particularly regarding how volunteers engaged with researchers and the <em>OED</em> team. Thousands of volunteers transcribed, discussed, and conducted research about early modern manuscripts, history, language, and culture, thereby gaining or enhancing research and paleographical skills they might not otherwise have had the opportunity to develop. Together with volunteers, the team helped advance the research agendas of six scholars, resulting in a half dozen publications that cite the contributions of volunteers. The team also encountered unexpected challenges relating to the data outputs of the project, which in turn led to new avenues of research at Zooniverse from 2016 to the time of writing, as well as a long-running effort to make the <em>SW</em> data usable.</p>

<h3 id="engagement-successes-volunteers-scholars-and-the-oed">Engagement Successes: Volunteers, Scholars, and the <em>OED</em></h3>
<p><em>Shakespeare’s World</em> attracted 3,926 registered volunteers, as well as anonymous participants (numbers unknown), who transcribed 11,490 digital images of manuscript pages (single and double page spreads) over a period of nearly four years (2015-2019). These included letters, recipes, and newsletters, an early form of manuscript newspaper delivery service that was curated for particular recipients.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">

</blockquote>
<p>Volunteers identified several words that were not previously included in the <em>OED</em>, as well as a ninety-year antedating of “partner” in the sense of spouse or lover, and a nearly two-hundred-year antedating of “white lie.” The <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> Talk board (a discussion forum for the project) was a vital space for what guest researcher Lisa Smith described as a form of collective close reading (close reading is a widely used form of literary analysis typically conducted by solo researchers).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> To take just one example of collective close reading and research from <em>SW</em> Talk, the team present the case of “taffytie tartes.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> This phrase was identified by volunteer @kodemunkey just eight days into the project. Lively discussion as to its exact meaning blossomed on Talk, as volunteers, early modern recipe researchers including Smith, Folger and Zooniverse staff, as well as <em>OED</em> Deputy Editor Philip Durkin shared evidence from the <em>OED</em>, other <em>SW</em> recipes, and their own research.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Durkin described our community process in a blog post, offering etymological starting points for the meaning of Taffytie (linking it to taffeta fabric), and a reflection on the value of our endeavor. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sources featured in Shakespeare’s World are particularly interesting and valuable for OED lexicographers. We have relatively easy access to a good deal of printed material from this period, now increasingly searchable in electronic collections. It is much harder for OED’s lexicographers to survey patterns of use in manuscript sources from this period, which often differ in interesting ways from printed sources—this can be in small features like spelling (as for instance taffytie), as well as in reflecting aspects of life (such as culinary recipes) that are relatively under-represented in the printed sources, or only appear there in a rather different light. This project therefore offers a new way in to some material that has previously been underexploited in tracing the history of English.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order for “taffytie tartes” to be included in the <em>OED</em> the editorial team needed additional evidence, and in particular dated evidence, which can be harder to derive from manuscript sources like recipe books that created for everyday practical use in family homes for ongoing use. Volunteers kept up their search on <em>Shakespeare’s World</em> and a few years later Van Hyning expanded the hunt for additional sources by reaching out to Mary-Anne Boermans, a finalist on the <em>Great British Bake Off</em> Season 2. Van Hyning was intrigued by Boermans’s historically informed baking practice, and had a hunch that Boermans might have come across taffety tartes in her research, and whether she’d be interested in the recipes from Folger.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Boermans <em>had</em> come across several recipes and had already included one in her first cookbook <em>Great British Bakes: Forgotten Treasures for Modern Bakers</em> (2013), but, as she wrote in a blog post for the Folger in 2019, many of the recipes she’d found were missing crucial information as to what made a Taffety Tart a Taffety Tart. The presence of thirteen recipes at the Wellcome confirmed that taffety tarts “were very much a ‘thing’ in seventeenth-century food fashion. Trying to define what exactly this ‘thing’ was, however, was more complicated than I first imagined.” The Folger examples provide crucial missing evidence about the fillings, pastry type, shape, bake time, temperature and decorative features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is almost a ‘complete package’ in terms of the details supplied, needing only to have been dated and include a drawing of the pastry shape in order to complete the picture. It might not be the jigsaw box cover image, but it’s definitely the four corner pieces of the puzzle, because it reveals that what this Jacobean pastry most resembles, with its thin, rectangular shape, fruit filling and icing is… a pop-tart. A seventeenth-century pop-tart.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boermans kindly baked four different examples and shared images of her work:</p>

<h3 id="shakespeares-world-data-cleaning-and-release"><em>Shakespeare’s World</em> Data Cleaning and Release</h3>
<p><em>SW</em> was always meant to be fun and inclusive: a place where people could learn about subjects and people they might never have considered. The <em>SW</em> team very consciously emphasized that volunteers could take part in—and even lead—discovery and research impact through the <em>OED</em> partnership, and also tried to make the transcription task itself as accessible to beginners as possible. The team hypothesized that by letting people choose to transcribe as little as a word or line they would only contribute what they felt confident reading, and that, in keeping with the broader Zooniverse methods of promoting nonspecialist engagement and multiple independent classifications followed by aggregation, the project would make crowdsourced transcription accessible and welcoming in new ways. This proved true, based on the feedback via Talk and other venues, but unfortunately the complexities of transcription—the slight differences of interpretation from one user to another, stemming from genuine ambiguities present in most documents rather than user mistakes—combined with the imprecision of clustering closely written lines of text, rendered much of the output data very difficult to use.</p>
<p>Each word on each page was independently transcribed by three or more people, and their transcriptions were compared and combined using a clustering algorithm and a genetic sequencing algorithm.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Our early aggregation testing was based on gold standard data produced by project staff at Folger, against which they compared transcriptions produced by Zooniverse staff, who included an early modernist with paleography expertise (Van Hyning) as well as folks without paleography training, including astronomers and developers, many of whom hold higher degrees in other fields including philosophy, ecology, and computer science. The project team also gathered transcription data from the pool of Zooniverse beta tester volunteers, a subset of the wider Zooniverse user community who test projects under development. Early aggregation results were promising, showing approximately 98 percent agreement between transcribers in many cases. But as the project went public and the heterogeneity of both the participants and the documents increased, clustering accuracy dipped, which negatively impacted text string comparison. In retrospect, it’s clear that our beta testing sample was too skewed towards people with higher degrees, relevant subject knowledge, and/or existing familiarity with the Zooniverse platform.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Thousands of volunteers transcribed, discussed, and conducted research about early modern manuscripts, history, language, and culture … [in] a form of collective close reading
</blockquote>
<p>From 2016 to 2018, the team made several attempts to improve aggregation for <em>SW</em> and the numerous transcription projects that also used similar methods of transcription (i.e. <em>AnnoTate</em> with Tate Britain, and <em>Decoding the Civil War</em> with the Huntington). The project had some success, but the overall results still require significant editing. For three years this was done by grant-funded staff at Folger. In 2021, <em>SW</em> Co-Investigators Heather Wolfe and Van Hyning worked with colleagues at Folger and the University of Maryland iSchool’s iConsultancy undergraduate capstone students on a <em>SW</em> data cleaning project.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> The students used the most recent iteration of aggregated data provided by Zooniverse, and focused on stripping out duplicate lines of text, which was one of the most common errors introduced by aggregation (this is based on visual inspection by former Folger palaeographer Sarah Powell, and <em>SW</em> Co-Is Wolfe and Van Hyning, rather than a full formal analysis of the data. Further quantitative analysis of different stages of <em>SW</em> data is planned for the future).</p>
<p>This level of intervention certainly allays any anxieties about quality control, and can be seen as the gold standard for cultural heritage practitioners wishing to present accurate and highly authoritative information to their patrons. However, this level of transformation and encoding is prohibitively labor intensive even without unexpected data-cleaning challenges. For this reason, since February 2019, Folger has started making plain text transcriptions available on their main discovery platform, a lightly customized off-the-shelf instance of Luna (<a href="luna.folger.edu">luna.folger.edu</a>). According to Folger metadata librarian Emily Whal, they added a transcription “‘Facet Search’ button on the collection home page [that] take[s] you to a list of the call numbers available in the collection.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>  On Luna, <em>SW</em> transcriptions join approximately 19,000 transcriptions produced on Folger’s in-house transcription system called Dromio, which was developed over fifteen years ago by Folger developer Mike Poston for Wolfe’s palaeography classes. Dromio continues to support pedagogy, as well as transcribathon events. As of October 2021, 7,271 <em>SW</em> transcriptions have been edited into these three presentations, encoded with TEI P-4 markup and published for search and download on the <em>Early Modern Manuscripts Online</em> (EMMO) platform (emmo.folger.edu). <a href="https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/FOLGER~3~3">Over 12,500 transcriptions have been incorporated into Luna</a>.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> To get to Luna, <em>SW</em> transcriptions that have been tidied up by the UMD students, but that haven’t gone through the <em>EMMO</em> treatment, are uploaded to the <a href="https://fromthepage.com/folger">FromThePage crowdsourcing platform</a> and edited by Folger docents, volunteers, and staff. In other words, the crowdsourced data are going through a further phase of crowdsourced editing. The <em>SW</em> transcriptions in Luna are not the same documents (yet) as those in <em>EMMO</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Both the successes and the challenges of Zooniverse transcription approaches on <em>SW</em> and its sister project <em>AnnoTate</em> led to important developments for the platform. The first was a successful grant bid to the IMLS in 2016 to develop new approaches to text transcription, explicitly to test whether collaborative or independent methods were more accurate. This supported the development of <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> and <em>Anti-Slavery Manuscripts</em>, and subsequent publications about data quality and volunteer engagement in independent versus collaborative methods of transcription.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Additional grant-funded work led by Samantha Blickhan resulted in a new text aggregation editing tool called <a href="https://alice.zooniverse.org/">ALI/CE</a>.</p>
<h2 id="by-the-people"><em>By the People</em></h2>
<p>Our next case study is the Library of Congress (LOC) <em>By the People</em> (<em>BTP</em>) crowdsourced transcription project. <em>BTP</em> features materials from across the LOC’s Special Collections divisions (Manuscript, Rare Book, Folklife, and others). These are arranged into “Campaigns” and presented to volunteers along with transcription conventions, a discussion platform, and explanatory material to help folks learn a bit about the subjects of the documents. These range from the papers of Rosa Parks, to those of presidents Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, and ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. Despite the heterogeneity of the documents that pass through the platform, and indeed the heterogeneity of metadata models within the LOC, the data outputs from the project are fairly easy to work with, and the rate of data publication has been fairly fast. <em>BTP</em> relies on volunteers being able to peer-review one another’s transcriptions. Pages can be transcribed and edited by multiple volunteers before being marked as “complete.” This review system enables collaboration between transcribers, and between transcribers and the LOC staff who support <em>BTP</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the foresight and advocacy of various stakeholders at the LOC, the project was well staffed and resourced from the outset and included provision for full-time community managers, a team of developers, user experience specialists, metadata specialists, and accessibility experts. The project&rsquo;s transition from a “pilot” effort funded through gift money, to “core infrastructure” funded through congressional appropriations, more than a year ahead of schedule, has been cited by Ben Brumfield of FromThePage as evidence for the “maturity of the [crowdsourcing transcription] methodology.”<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Part of the success of <em>BTP</em> stems from LOC staff’s ability to publish the transcriptions. Although the project was built on a separate transcription platform, the expectation from the start was that the data should return to loc.gov (the Library’s main web property and discovery system) early and often. Our first data round-trip occurred less than three months after launch, and consisted of 781 pages from across the five original campaigns.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> The <em>BTP</em> team and stakeholders worked together to identify a data pathway, including relevant metadata fields, on-screen presentation, appropriate language to describe and acknowledge volunteer efforts, and important internal questions about custodial responsibility for the data over time. The project team went into this process aware of the challenges, but also aware of possible workarounds and solutions. The incorporation of OCR into loc.gov was a helpful precedent, as was the fact loc.gov is a bespoke system maintained by a team of internal engineers and developers.</p>
<p>Though glad of this early success, the team quickly learned from users who consulted manuscripts online that it was confusing when some pages in a letter or journal were transcribed and others were not. The team thought it was best to publish any data when it became available, but user feedback revealed it was best to wait until full documents are done. So the team changed their approach from March 2019 onward, waiting until entire Campaigns of documents (i.e. the Branch Rickey papers or Rosa Parks’s papers) are completed, before the results are ingested into loc.gov.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Of the over 620,000 documents made available on <em>BTP</em> since October 2018, roughly 392,000 pages have been transcribed, reviewed, and marked as complete by volunteers, and 63,400 have been incorporated into loc.gov. The data are published in two ways. First, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?in=&amp;q=%22volunteers+participating+in+the+By%22&amp;new=true">the transcriptions</a> are embedded in the metadata for individual pages as well as full documents. They appear alongside the images of the original manuscripts, thus creating pathways to individual pages. These transcriptions can be downloaded as .txt files either one page at a time or as whole documents. An attribution to the volunteers appears in two places, first as an overlay in the on-screen display for each page, and embedded in the .txt transcription file itself: “Transcribed and reviewed by volunteers participating in the <em>By The People</em> project at crowd.loc.gov.” The second way that LOC makes the transcriptions available is as <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=contributor:by+the+people+(program)">bulk datasets</a> consisting of a .CSV file and README file detailing the context in which the data were originally collected on <em>BTP</em>. Bulk datasets have different affordances from individual .txt files.</p>

<h2 id="the-david-c-driskell-papers-project"><em>The David C. Driskell Papers Project</em></h2>
<p>Our final case study features a project devoted to the legacy of the late David C. Driskell, professor emeritus of art and art history at the University of Maryland. The University of Maryland’s <a href="https://driskellcenter.umd.edu/">David C. Driskell Center</a> (DCDC) is an art gallery, archive, and educational center founded with the central mission of celebrating Black artists and art history. It was founded by colleagues of Driskell after his retirement, as a mark of respect and admiration for his incredible contributions to art history, education, and artistic production. Driskell was an American artist and educator who was instrumental in establishing Black art as a scholarly field of study: he generated a significant correspondence with leading artists including Alan Porter and Georgia O’Keefe, as well as his students and mentees.</p>
<p>Professor Driskell died due to complications of Covid-19 on April 1, 2020. In order to celebrate and remember this fixture of both the University of Maryland and of the art community, Van Hyning collaborated with colleagues at the Driskell Center, and six MLIS students to create a crowdsourcing project on the From the Page platform featuring his archives, such as letters and journals. <a href="https://fromthepage.com/umdtranscription/david-c-driskell-papers"><em>The David C. Driskell Papers Project</em></a> (<em>DCDPP</em>) is hosted within the Driskell Center as an online crowdsourced transcription project hosted in the FromThePage platform. The transcription project exists alongside an exhibit of Driskell’s papers also hosted by the DCDC. While not immediately related, both the transcription project and the exhibition existed to celebrate the life of Driskell and invite the public to share in the memory of his life and legacy.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The transcription project focuses predominantly on the written documents contained within the curated collection of personal papers. The team endeavored to make Driskell’s personal papers and the accompanying transcriptions easily accessible to best serve both an informational role and an accessibility role for researchers attempting to learn more about his life and the impact of his efforts to raise awareness of the quality, quantity, and vibrancy of Black art in America and abroad. The project launched in February 2021 with a corpus of over 1,200 documents, and additional materials have been uploaded since. Volunteers and some of the original project team have transcribed over 1,300 pages of documents and staff have begun work on indexing these transcriptions following review and OCR corrections.</p>

<p>But for all the ease of using FTP to produce usable transcription data for the digitized objects in the collection, there were known issues from the outset when it came to the storage and presentation of the transcription data on the DCDC’s existing CMS. The DCDC employs PastPerfect, a CMS that is typically used by museums and galleries to catalog and describe physical objects rather than archives. This software is designed with the stated intent to be used in all manner of cultural heritage institutions, not just galleries or museums. PastPerfect’s own website says that “over 11,000 museums, historical societies, archives, libraries, and other collecting institutions worldwide have purchased PastPerfect Museum Software since its first release in 1998”; however, the fundamental structure of PastPerfect is not ideal for archival metadata structures and arrangement.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> The system assumes that each record pertains to one physical item such as a painting or sculpture, for which a few photos will suffice, but an archival item might consist of hundreds of pages, and there might be numerous items in a given folder or box which are not described at the item much less the page level. The record structure isn’t granular enough. Furthermore, other than a notes field, there is no space within the PastPerfect CMS to represent transcription data. To use a notes field in this system, the DCDC archivist would have to manually upload each transcription, which is too labor intensive for this organization.</p>
<p>The project team knew about these issues prior to creating the <em>DCDPP</em> crowdsourced transcription project, as they are common in the GLAM community. Even highly specialized repositories tend to have a mixture of formats that most CMSs don’t quite cater to. The Zooniverse project <a href="https://anno.tate.org.uk/#/"><em>AnnoTate</em></a> (2015–2019), with Tate Archive, was designed to produce transcription data for a <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/archive/collections">bespoke CMS</a> that unites object and archival records. They embarked on <em>DCDPP</em> in part to gain insights and data for our ongoing conversations about how best to serve the heterogeneous materials housed at the DCDC. Crowdsourcing projects, especially smaller scale pilot projects, can empower cultural heritage institutions to experiment with incorporating more diverse and nontraditional data into their CMSs, and hopefully also give them the data they need to advocate for their needs to vendors who supply those systems. While the larger questions of CMS type unfold, the team can publish the Driskell data in a number of venues, including the DCDC’s main website or the <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/dbfinder/id/UMD05542">Digital Repository of the University of Maryland</a> (DRUM).</p>
<h2 id="integrating-solutions-for-transcription-data">Integrating Solutions for Transcription Data</h2>
<p>Regardless of how crowdsourced data are managed and made available, data management planning is a necessary part of crowdsourcing, and conversations about how to achieve data publication or integration should start as early as possible. Solving these questions ahead of launch, and preparing for potential content management issues, can ensure that projects meet the institutional or individual’s vision more effectively. If you’re a GLAM practitioner using an off-the-shelf CMS, talk to your vendor. Find out if your license or product level includes a capacious enough field for transcriptions. Find out whether you can import content in bulk or whether you have to cut and paste transcriptions one at a time. Be up front with your volunteers about your ambitions for the data, as well as current limitations.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Archives typically arrange and describe materials at the level of items (the journal, the letter) or boxes (a collection of folders with letters from various correspondents) rather than pages, whereas transcriptions bring us right down to the page level.
</blockquote>
<p>As institutions such as the Folger have begun ingesting their data, we’ve learned more about the widespread challenges of ingesting long runs of text into CMSs—no matter how clean the data from crowdsourcing platforms are—whether these are off-the-shelf products or bespoke systems created by institutions. Sometimes metadata managers can shoehorn transcriptions into a field without a character count limit, but the status of the transcriptions within archival description is uncertain and still emerging. Archives typically arrange and describe materials at the level of items (the journal, the letter) or boxes (a collection of folders with letters from various correspondents) rather than pages, whereas transcriptions bring us right down to the page level. The technical fixes may be relatively simple, but there’s a much more significant shift that needs to happen at the level of archival practice and cultural norms.</p>
<p>Data publication can take a wide variety of forms in order to meet the varying demands for different projects and the visions of different institutions hosting a crowdsourced transcription project. There may not be a one-size-fits-all solution, especially when we consider that most institutions have quirky ways of describing rare materials in the first place—quirks that are shaped by the materials themselves, the many layers of metadata that accrue to objects over time, and the affordances and limitations of different CMSs. Whatever the quirks, though, crowdsourced data deserves a place in the authoritative record. Data can be posted in bulk as .CSV files on institutional webpages, GitHub, Internet Archive or other repositories, and/or in metadata fields that connect the transcription directly to the image in question. Data should also, ideally, be publicized and described in articles and blog posts where they may reach a wide range of potential users—the <a href="https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/"><em>Journal of Open Humanities Data</em></a> is one such venue (Van Hyning serves on the editorial board of the Journal, Jones as a copyeditor). Collaborators on the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> project do a blend of several of these approaches for the <a href="https://genizalab.princeton.edu/resources/datasets"><em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> data</a>. A stopgap to these solutions would be a simple note in a metadata field, a finding aid, and/or on an institution’s website saying that transcription data for a given page, document, or collection can be made available upon request. This would enable institutions to better meet the needs of Blind users or others who use screen reader technologies to access web-based written content. This would be a move towards 508 compliance, specifically making projects and their outputs more accessible to people who use screen readers.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> If organizations doing crowdsourced transcription have concrete plans for data storage and accessibility at the outset of the project, they will be in a stronger position to achieve Web Content Accessibility Guide (WCAG 2.0 or 2.1) compliance in the transcription data display.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew:</strong> In this piece Steffy and I continue the conversation from our April 2021 panel in order to explain the basis of our collaboration, the processes by which we analyze Geniza texts and, most importantly, the stakes of crowdsourcing projects for historical research. Steffy’s work in compiling collections of Geniza fragments with similar formatting, scribal hands, and ink stamps alerted me to the existence of document types that could have otherwise taken months or years to locate. Her individual contributions speak volumes for the ways in which a vast network of <em>Scribes</em> contributors has accelerated the accessibility of Geniza texts. Contributors like Steffy are tackling foundational questions in the field of Cairo Geniza Studies that have never been pursued on such a mass scale. From the moment I happened upon the <em>Scribes</em> discussion boards in the summer of 2020, I was struck by the abundance of user collections and comments regarding the distinctions between genres of literary and documentary fragments.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Steffy, in your volunteer work and collections, what are the core features within the layout of texts that you focus on in order to distinguish between fragment types?</p>
<p><strong>Steffy:</strong> Since I can’t read Arabic or Hebrew, I take skilled handwriting in straight lines with justified margins as signs of the work of professional scribes. Many, but not all, literary texts are neatly written by professional scribes using “square” Hebrew letters, with strictly justified margins. Liturgical poetry, for example, whether written by a scribe or not, might have an unjustified left margin, with a pattern of longer and shorter lines, like poetry in English, but read from right to left. Careful layout, good margins, and straight lines of beautiful script indicate to me that a fragment is “literary,” but other literary fragments (sermons, for example) may lack these features. I’m often unsure what type of fragment I’m looking at, so I like to read the notes on a fragment from the library that holds it, and any comments at the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> site. This slows my volunteer work, but greatly enriches my experience.</p>
<p>The documentary texts are widely varied. Many legal documents, for example, look like the work of professional scribes. Letters from one merchant to another, some with margins crammed full of text written at an angle to the main text, look urgent rather than orderly. Still others are scrawled on re-used scraps of paper in handwriting that is far from well trained. That was true of the “communal register” which you mentioned during our panel last April. In those fragments, a less skilled writer kept dated weekly records that always included some simple math sums. What might these fragments be?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew:</strong> Just as you have noted, Steffy, besides the layout of texts and the economical usage of paper, some other features for assessing the genre of Geniza fragments lie in script usage and the distribution of numerical figures. Square Hebrew letters, or “ מרובע / merūbaʿ,” are indeed a helpful indicator for tracing sacred literary texts. In the period I work on, between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, many Geniza texts begin to bear the influence of Sephardi <em>rashi</em> and <em>solitreo</em> scripts. As a result of the immigration of Sephardi refugees into Egypt across the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries—but especially after the Spanish expulsion of the 1492 CE—Geniza fragments portray the increased influence of Iberian systems of Hebrew script.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Studying <em>solitreo</em> letter forms—which were more commonly used in writing Judeo-Spanish—can also be helpful for understanding how a variety of documents from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries incorporate cursive writing. So, for example, in the Judeo-Arabic communal register I referenced during our panel, on occasion, there are interconnected letters in repeating words such as “berakha / blessing / ברכה” (in purple), “fiḍḍa / silver / פצה” (in green), and “seder / order / סדר” (in red).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> These cursive forms give the initial impression of messiness and lack of scribal skill yet it’s crucial to recognize the pragmatic significance of this writing method. Connecting letters and abbreviating Judeo-Arabic words such as “ת׳׳ע / t[asāwī] ʿa[la]” (in blue) increased the speed at which a scribe could record notes when calligraphic aesthetics were not the objective.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The surnames mentioned in each list–such as Vialobos, Ḥadād, and Skenderī –embody the lives of individuals and families who experienced one of the most turbulent periods in Egyptian political history. Between 1798–1801 CE, the Egyptian populace withstood immense hardship in their efforts to defeat the French occupation and then between 1801–1805 as Ottoman military factions fought to assert their control over the province (a process which resulted in Muḥammad ʿAlī&rsquo;s rise to power as Pasha/Governor). What makes these register entries so significant, then, is that they offer a continuous internal perspective on how Cairene Jews supported their communal institutions during a period of harrowing instability.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> In my dissertation, I am working to compile the donation data from the many page fragments of these registers. This line of investigation may have never emerged in my research had it not been for my chance encounter with Steffy’s collection in the <em>Scribes</em> database.</p>
<p><strong>Steffy:</strong> Shortly after I began volunteering in early 2018, a batch of these oddly similar fragment images started to pop up. Volunteers could tell these Hebrew script fragments were the work of a single less skilled writer but not why he had written so many similar-looking notes. They did not look like religious texts, legal documents, or letters.</p>
<p>A basic task for the “citizen humanists” who volunteer in the <em>Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</em> project is to try to sort images of the fragments which accumulated in the Geniza for nearly a thousand years into two piles: those in Hebrew script, and those which display some Arabic script. Even for volunteers who, like me, cannot read these scripts, this is usually easy to do.</p>
<p>As I wondered what these fragments were, I realized that each one had areas which showed math sums done in Eastern Arabic numerals.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Perhaps these fragments were entries in a ledger recording an activity which might interest an historian someday?</p>
<p>I had just begun keeping a list on paper of these fragments when one with an Arabic seal (a rare feature which volunteers are asked to report) and large, beautiful Arabic writing on one side appeared on my computer screen. Startled, I decided to make a digital collection of these fragments, hoping that they might be useful to someone’s scholarly research.</p>
<p>But I never imagined that I would meet that person.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as more and more of these fragments turned up and added to my collection, <em>Scribes</em> project researchers Jasmin Shinohara and Professor Marina Rustow provided information about the dates and partial translation of the text of the fragments.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> I am very grateful to them both for that information, and for giving time and attention to the curiosity of a new volunteer at <em>Scribes</em> who wondered what she was looking at.</p>

The serendipity of being able to collaborate on and to answer these questions is a rare opportunity. The seal you included in the register collection is crucial for two reasons. Its significance lies, firstly, in the dating– where the Hijrī year ١١٧٧/1177 AH or 1763/64 CE is visible (in purple):<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>

<p>When we read the Hijrī year 1177 AH on the recycled paper against the dating of the upper layer of usage (September 29–October 5, 1799)– a difference of roughly 35 years emerges.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> This timespan marks the initial lifecycle of a piece of paper that lost its utility but was later cut up and bound within a communal register. As Rustow has shown with medieval Geniza sources, early modern ones too can help us analyze the periodicity of paper recycling in Egypt.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The other point of significance with this seal is that the register entries recorded over it reference a specific congregation and synagogue in Cairo: “ק׳׳ק תורקייה / K[ehillat] K[odesh] Tūrkīya.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> This connection is critical because it frames one of the communal settings in which these sources were recorded. When we collect in-text locational references, our opportunities multiply for studying the lives of individuals: more specifically, in tracing their donorship activities and congregational membership.</p>
<p>Steffy’s and my own initial encounters with these fragments have yielded a chain of shared findings that ties back into a broader web of individual contributions in the <em>Scribes</em> database. The initial results of this network of collaboration and those on the horizon underscore the stakes of crowdsourcing in historical research. Moreover, our findings capture the continued resonance of Solomon Schechter’s words when he stated:</p>
<p>“<em>The Geniza is a world, with all its religious and secular aspirations, longings and disappointments, and it requires a world to interpret a world, or at least a large staff of workers</em>.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

<p>Jessica L. Goldberg and Eve Krakowski offer a helpful overview of the distinctions between literary and documentary fragments: “forms of <em>geniza</em> practice varied not only among communities but also over time, with some periods during which the Ben Ezra Geniza was in use seeing significant deposits of non-sacred material. Most of the Geniza papers–about 380,000 folio pages in all–are fragments of literary manuscripts, largely on religious subjects. But somewhere between thirty and fifty thousand fragments are what is usually termed <em>documentary material</em>; that is, they are everyday writings, texts written not to convey ideas to an anonymous and long-lasting audience but to communicate with specific recipients for immediate practical purposes.” Jessica L. Goldberg and Eve Krakowski, “Introduction: A Handbook for Documentary Geniza Research in the Twenty-First Century,” in “Documentary Geniza Research in the Twenty-First Century,” eds.

We use words, pictures, and diagrams. We describe, share, show, and fail.</p>
<p>Humanists continue to expand the range of objects they study, but the range of scholarly outputs has not seen a similar expansion. While there are movements within Digital Humanities to consider nontraditional formats, the presentation and publishing of these experimental works (such as installations and project demos) are still secondary or sidelined, where they exist at all. What would it look like to consider non-textual research outputs as first-order scholarly work? The historian David Staley suggests the terms “interpretive objects” or “humanistic objects” for creative scholarly acts that are not limited to text;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein offer the broader term “rhetorical objects.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This kind of innovative work is carefully researched and theorized. It deserves scholarly engagement and intellectual rigor even if it does not fit into established modes of scholarly communication.</p>
<p>Academic research has a long history of textual practice and citation that we haven’t yet figured out how to adapt to non-textual scholarship. Both the <a href="https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/">Journal of Open Humanities Data</a> and the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> can be seen as steps in this direction: they provide venues for the review and publication of data and software, respectively, accompanied by brief “metapapers.” But even these journals rely on transforming the content they review—data and software—into text in order to function! What are the implications if we truly expand the range of accepted scholarly outputs to include such interpretive objects as data structures, databases, software, datasets, physical objects, and augmented reality experiences? Will scholars need to become experts in all these modes, or can we find a way to become conversant in multiple forms of argumentation, as with other important scholarly theories?</p>
<p>The pieces that follow describe four different data physicalizations, which we consider to be one class of interpretive object. This is an exploration of our work as we wrestle with how to present physical objects in a non-physical medium, objects meant to be held, touched, or viewed from different angles. Not quite metapaper, manual, or manifesto — these are guides toward reading and thinking in creative new scholarly modes.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Data physicalization represents data in physical form.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Like other approaches to understanding and representing data, it highlights particular senses to communicate information, specifically touch and sight.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> But data physicalization is distinct from other sensory approaches in that it bridges the gap between creative, physical, and conceptual exploration, a nexus often associated with critical making.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> Data physicalizations surface the amount of labor involved with data production and representation; they lend data different perspectives and dimensions.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> These physicalizations also create an opportunity for viewers to become active participants in the making of a piece using data.</p>
<p>Data physicalization attempts to defamiliarize us from the many two-dimensional data representations we have seen by literally placing data in the <em>mise en scène</em> of a conceptual exploration. There is something unique about turning data points into physical forms and placing them in space, something that triggers the mind to understand data in a distinctive way.</p>

<p>Other approaches for data representation and interpretation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Visualization, which focuses on storytelling by using graphical elements</li>
<li>Data Edibilization, which focuses on experiencing data through food using edible materials</li>
<li>Data Sonification, which focuses on auditory patterns by using sound</li>
<li>Data Visceralization, which focuses on physical and emotional experience by using multiple senses and affect, making it the only approach that emphasizes emotion.</li>
<li>Data Art, which focuses on representing links between data and artistic creations by using expressive frameworks and raw data.</li>
<li>Interpretive object, which focuses on revealing meanings and relationships via non-textual forms by using metaphors.</li>

<p>There is an ethics of drawing on other senses. Feminist philosopher Donna Haraway describes “visualizing technologies” as the “god trick of seeing everything from nowhere.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Klein and D’Ignazio expand on this, demonstrating that the assumed neutrality and objectivity of even the simplest visualizations always come from a particular perspective, usually a dominant cultural view that fundamentally excludes and marginalizes.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<p>This is especially the case when making data visualizations accessible to vision-impaired readers. The typical solution is to provide a table with the data underlying the chart or graph. This isn’t practical for large datasets, and it’s clearly not the same experience; otherwise, we would provide the tabular data to all users. Another approach is to provide an extended description sharing the insights gained from the chart.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> This is helpful, but pre-digesting the chart in this way doesn’t allow readers to perceive and interpret the patterns and draw their own conclusions. Tactile data physicalizations provide sensory forms that offer individuals the opportunity to explore and discover patterns in the data for themselves.</p>
<p>Approaching an object like a data physicalization on display encourages bodily engagement in physical space. It encourages the person encountering it to consider multiple angles and perspectives, and it should raise questions about how the objects are meant to be read. This touching requires proximity and a certain intimacy.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> For Emmanuel Levinas, the “ocularcentrism” of western civilization has produced a false sense that vision is synonymous with objectivity; he proposes instead the metaphor of touch as the basis for ethical engagement with the Other. Ocularcentrism requires distance or separation and encourages objectification and mastery of that which is viewed.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> French feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray extends this metaphor in her notion of the “caress,” which “weds without consum(mat)ing.”<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Because touch requires intimacy, boundaries, and consent, it offers connection without the taint of mastery.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>

<p>These are not artist statements because this is not art; these objects might look like Data Art, but the goals and methods are different. This is representation, correspondence, laborious translation. These are our attempts to communicate our goals, to help you to <em>read</em> and interpret these unfamiliar objects, and to be challenged by the potential of physicalization.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The Shakespeare and Company lending library is best known for its famous members — writers such as Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, Aimé Césaire, and Simone de Beauvoir. We wanted to highlight the activity of the relatively unknown members — many of them women — who in fact represent a much larger portion of the library&rsquo;s day-to-day activity and thus arguably better represent it than do the prominent names. This piece makes use of unit origami to create a larger, cohesive form from small folded units, mirroring the relationship between the overall membership of the library and a single member.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

<p>The physicalization contrasts the activity of the better known members of the lending library — those linked by researchers to an entry in the <a href="https://viaf.org/">Virtual International Authority File</a> (VIAF)<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> — with the activity of relatively unknown members with no known authority record.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> Activity is represented by the total number of borrowing events that would plausibly have brought members into the library, namely checking out and returning books. Names of the lesser known members are printed on the paper used to create the octahedron as a way of corporealizing and “re-humanizing” humanities data.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> By holding the physicalization in two different ways, the user can “grasp” two separate sets of data: the octahedron (non-famous members) and the cube (famous members). The ratio of the volumes of these two solids reflects the use of the library by these two different groups.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>

The majority section of the pie chart represents the 14,583 library members who we identified as “lesser known” because they are not listed in VIAF. The minority section represents the 6,248 members who are listed in VIAF, often because they were involved with a well-known creative work.

<p>A pie chart can be used to present the same ratio of data conveyed in the physicalization; this representation is useful when we want to illustrate a situation where we know the totality of the data. Pie charts also depict a world where data fit neatly into mutually exclusive categories. The act of grasping the two intersecting solids in our physicalization is a response to this approach: the membership data of the lending library is a work in progress, updated as researchers comb through archives that are fragmentary and incomplete. One cannot see all sides of a three-dimensional solid simultaneously. By representing our data as intersecting solids, we instead mirror the fuzzy distinction between “famous” and “non-famous” members, acknowledging the intersection of the varied identities of the library’s members.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>Using cut, punched, or embossed paper would make the piece more tactile; instead of simply printing names, we could add unique patterns to represent membership and borrowing activities for individual members. In the future, we could use generative methods to create unique folding patterns for individual library member activity and make them available via print-on-demand. This would enable viewers to become participants and turn folding into an act of recovery of the stories of the lesser known library members.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>

<p>This data physicalization demonstrates the affordances of three dimensions for representing data: time series data are displayed with sequential months and years adjacent to each other, which makes it easier to discern seasonal and annual trends. I hope to inspire others to try experimental approaches to representing data; writing software to generate printable 3D models directly from the data makes the process reproducible, and may eventually enable others to create and print their own physicalizations. The tactile nature of the object suggests the possibilities of 3D printing to create more accessible representations of data.</p>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>This is a two-variable, three-dimensional lollipop chart showing the membership of the Shakespeare and Company lending library and bookshop, by month and year, from November 1919 when Sylvia Beach opened her bookshop to its official closing in 1941.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Membership data are drawn from two different sources, both of which are incomplete: broad membership information comes from <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/logbooks/">logbooks</a> (although logbooks for 1930, parts of 1931–32, and 1937 are missing); detailed borrowing histories come from <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/cards/">lending library cards</a> for a subset of members.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The white octahedrons represent the number of members with an active membership in each month; the green icospheres correspond to the number of members with borrowing activity in each month.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> For any month where the value is zero, there is no lollipop. Representing the two different datasets as adjacent, half lollipops exposes the discrepancies between the stories these sources tell us about the membership of the library without privileging either of them.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Using two different shapes makes the two parts of the physicalization distinguishable to touch. The two lollipop charts are designed to be printed independently and then assembled, so that any 3D printer can be used. In this version, the two pieces slide together; this is both a simplification and an improvement over the previous version, where one piece was placed on top of the other.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup></p>

Plotting documented membership accounts against borrowing activity shows the differences in members tracked across the two sources. The Shakespeare and Company Project has information about the borrowing activity of 11% of lending library members. For the 1920s, the percentage is lower: only 6%. But in the 1930s, the percentage is higher: 23%. Some months show more members with borrowing activity than total members because information on the cards overlaps gaps in logbook coverage.
</div>
<p>The same membership data can be presented in a two-variable bar chart. Overall trends are easy to see, and both representations of the data make it possible to compare the two data series against each other. Seasonal trends are visible in the bar chart, but it’s difficult to identify distinct months; in contrast, changing perspective on the 3D lollipop chart allows us to focus on yearly or monthly trends. Missing data in one variable are visible in both, but seem more striking in the 3D version where the base of the piece is bare without any lollipop tops. At the current scale, touching the piece requires focusing attention on just a portion of the object but invites exploration, which can proceed in any direction.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> While the bar chart demands sequential reading from left to right, the 3D printed object doesn’t provide or demand a particular starting point or sequence.</p>
<p>The bar chart conveys a sense of certitude and exactness that does not reflect the missing and partial data that underlie it; the 3D printed object, with its irregularities and fragility, is more representative of the contingent, historical data.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="next-steps-1">Next Steps</h3>
<p>The current version uses different shapes for the two variables, but adding textures would make the model even more tactile. Simple 3D printed labels with text and braille have been added for display alongside the piece, but they could be incorporated directly on the model, and refined to provide a scale for the axes.<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> The 3D printed objects could also be augmented with other media: lights or sound could convey the intensity of borrowing activity, or threads connecting months could represent the number of subscription renewals and convey a sense of continuity. The Python code used to create these models could be generalized for reuse, and eventually made available as a Blender plugin.<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> New shapes or approaches could be used to leverage innovations in 3D modeling, such as generative design, to create objects that are more inviting to touch and even more distinct from 2D data visualizations. 3D models could be revised for fabrication with CNC machines to create objects out of wood instead of plastic, which could make them more inviting to touch.</p>

<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
<p>This weaving represents the references in Chapter 1 of Jacques Derrida’s <em>de la Grammatologie</em> (1967). The references have been cataloged and categorized by the research team of Derrida’s Margins.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> Each type of reference (epigraph, citation, quotation, footnote) is represented by a distinct yarn and weaving pattern. Derrida’s highly intertextual writing suggested the idea of weaving.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Using yarn to symbolize the foundational work of deconstructionism, which operates by finding the place where a text unravels, gives additional depth to this physicalization.</p>
<p>Working with textiles is often stereotyped as female activity; therefore this piece also raises questions of gender and other false binaries such as art versus craft, high- versus low-tech. Based on anthropological research, women produced most of the textiles in the ancient world, but that work can be read as female authorship involved in the earliest textual practices.<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> The loom itself runs the gamut from high to low technology: a backstrap loom can be assembled at home from dowels, rods, and cords; and yet, Joseph-Marie Jacquard’s 1801 power loom, which used punch cards to automatically create elaborate woven patterns, was an important precursor to early computers.</p>

<p>The data encoded in the weaving could be represented as a stacked bar chart, a familiar and easily available choice for communicating types and quantities. However, the bar chart may be the least effective for communicating the depth and conceptual nuance of data on multiple levels.</p>

The chart shows that quotations are the most common type of reference in Chapter 1, and a few pages include six or more quotations. Footnotes are the next most common reference; there is only one epigraph, on the first page in the chapter, and one citation, on page 35. Only six pages have no references at all, and many pages have more than one.

<p>The ability to feel the density and frequency of each type of reference, color coded above, creates a unique experience for each participant, specific to their own perspective. These organic experiences bring to light the depth and complexities of the original work as well as the labor involved with gathering this data. This woven piece, which represents the first half (thirteen pages) of the first chapter of <em>De la grammatologie</em> is thirty-seven inches long, a little more than three feet. The physical nature of this data representation required that materials and dimensions be carefully calculated and measured.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> The process of creating this piece is embodied and experiential, which naturally leads to conversations that effortlessly surface the labor of data work and the depth of the original text. Unfortunately, this is less likely to happen naturally when creating data visualizations.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps-2">Next Steps</h3>
<p>Adding conductive thread and sensors could turn the weaving into an interface, so that touching the fabric would bring up the relevant reference on an associated screen. Data weavings could also be augmented with other media, such as light and sound, to convey other aspects of the same or related data. Incorporating other work on automated weaving and knitting machines would add to the variety of options for data textiles.</p>

<h3 id="goal-3">Goal</h3>
<p>This piece aims to reveal the continuity and growth of Sylvia Beach’s lending library and bookshop by showing the extent of activity and recorded membership based on logbooks and lending library cards. Multiple variables are encoded in the dimensions of stacking boxes based on the technique of pop-up box folds. By exhibiting the evolution of the library over time while contrasting activities of new and old members, this piece enables multiple ways to compare and interpret the data. By transforming a flat surface to a three-dimensional form with play of light and shadows, this production technique serves as a metaphor for the larger purpose of the <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/">Shakespeare and Company Project</a> — bringing archival data to life and facilitating rich interpretations.</p>

<h3 id="description-3">Description</h3>
<p>Shakespeare and Company Project lending library membership data from 1919 to 1941 are represented as a hybrid of time-series and stacked bar charts showing part-to-whole relationships made from paper and folding. Each unit, a cuboid in space and sometimes its stacking child, represents one year and displays nine variables for that year. The height corresponds to the number of active members recorded in the <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/logbooks/">logbooks</a>; the depth depicts the number of members with borrowing activity, according to each member’s <a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/cards/">lending library card</a>; the length along the timeline is based on the total number of borrowing events.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> Each of the variables is split into two parts: previous members who have renewed a membership contrasted with new members. The upper portion shows the growth and the activities of new readers. Viewers can see the rise and fall of members, inspect the difference between members with borrowing activity and the members as represented in the logbooks, compare the growth over time by viewing the stacking part from the front, and survey the involvement of continuing members versus new members, to name a few possibilities. In some cases, a small number of new members were very active readers based on their borrowing activity.</p>

<p>This physicalization made use of kirigami technique, which transforms single sheets of paper into three-dimensional forms. Data was mapped to the shapes with <a href="http://data-illustrator.com/">Data Illustrator</a>, semi-manual calculation, and vector drawing. The materiality and the process have a poetic connection to the subject matter, metaphorically: stories and knowledge can be embedded on flat papers, but the act of reading unfolds the surface into interpretive space even beyond three dimensions.</p>

Members with borrowing events constitute a fraction of all the members in the earlier years. The overall number of borrowing events increases gradually from 1919 to 1926, drops off slightly, then evidently increases from 1934 to 1939, even though the number of members drops drastically after 1929. It’s not easy to compare book borrowing by new members across the years.
</div>
<p>With current off-the-shelf visualization tools like the ones that come with Google Sheets, these three data series can generate three separate stacked bar charts. Since the numbers have different ranges, the vertical axes are drawn in different scales, which makes comparison across series impossible. The aggregate version presented here required manual adjustment to combine the separated charts and to make the Y axes comparable. In this 2D version, various activities of the growing membership body are not linked, and it’s difficult to draw connections between active members and the intensity of their activities because spatially these bars are not adjacent to each other. In the conventional pie charts, although the part-whole relationship between new membership activity and all activity is apparent, comparing across the three types of activities is not possible.</p>

Overall, renewed members outsize new members before 1929, followed by five years with nearly two times more new members than renewed members. Members with borrowing events represent a fraction of all the members in the early years between 1919 and 1929. Then members with borrowing events grow and become more comparable to the size of all members, which sizes down drastically after 1929. Borrows from new members outsize renewed members since 1934. It is not easy to compare the proportion of growth across the years.
</div>
<p>Extending into physical space allows data to be encoded in three axes and provides multiple possible angles to view the piece, depending on the relationships one is interested in. Different angles can reveal new interactions between logbook members, members with lending library card activities, and borrowing events. The separation of renewing and new members makes it possible to juxtapose and compare activities between the two groups of members. Spatial factors communicate different facets of the data, and color coding is no longer required.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of developing this project as practice-based research, making and reflecting are in constant oscillation, and knowing happens in actions. As I worked through this piece and observed the artifact, new questions emerged: how do we measure the level of liveliness of the lending library? Is it by the number of members or by the number of borrowing events? Instead of drawing comparisons by the lengths along each axis, perhaps perhaps we might look at the vibrancy of the lending library in a different way: through the volumes and relative sizes of the cuboids and rectangles, which factor in both the number of members and the borrowing activity.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps-3">Next Steps</h3>
<p>The pattern generation process is very programming-friendly and the materials required are also easily accessible. The data encoding process could be automated by custom code, which could then be made available as a tool for presenting part-to-whole relationships in other datasets. With the addition of dynamic media such as projection mapping, this piece could convey more context and narratives around the lending library.</p>

<p>We wanted to include a 3D model of this physicalization in order to provide some semblance of virtually grasping and rotating the object. Because we didn’t have a way to capture the actual object in 3D, we created a model of it in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>; this was fairly straightforward, since it consists of two simple shapes.&#160;<a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>We do not provide a how-to for this object out of respect for the copyright of origami authors, who often spend years developing and refining single designs. The three-dimensional forms used to make this piece are a combination of two modular origami units which are the original creations of the brilliant Tomoko Fuse, and can be found in her book <em>Unit Origami</em>. The octahedron is formed from eight units with triangular windows, and these windows are filled with eight so-called E-b units that create the illusion of an intersecting cube. Fuse, <em>Multidimensional Origami,</em> 109, 233. When assembling from your own paper, you can print <a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/1/data-beyond-vision/non_viaf_names.pdf">a document containing the names of the non-VIAF members of the library</a> onto the paper before folding the octahedron.

<p>A <a href="https://datavizproject.com/data-type/lollipop-chart/">lollipop chart</a> is a bar chart variant that uses dots to mark the values.

<p><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> is an open-source 3D modeling creation suite which includes a Python API. I experimented with multiple other solutions for generating 3D models programmatically, including <a href="https://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dbrgn/tangible">Tangible</a>, but found they were too limited and couldn’t handle a model of the size and complexity I needed to generate for this dataset, so I eventually settled on Blender and Python.

<p>The word “text” comes from Latin <em>textus,</em> literally “thing woven” and from the verb <em>texere,</em> “to weave.” According to Kathryn Sullivan Kruger, “the connection between weaving (textiles) and language (texts) becomes so entangled as to be almost impossible to separate. In many languages, including English, the verb to weave defines not just the making of textiles, but any creative act.” Kathryn Sullivan Kruger, <em>Weaving the Word: The Metaphorics of Weaving and Female Textual Production</em> (Cranbury, NJ: Rosemont Publishing &amp; Printing, 2001), 29.

I’m not talking about the Victorian orphan kind of dying, not the dying of storybooks, but children who were terminally ill.</p>
<p>I was twelve and fixated on books written by an author with the improbable name of Lurlene McDaniel. The first book I encountered was <em>Six Months to Live</em>, which chronicled the life of a popular teenager in the wake of her diagnosis with leukemia. Not all of McDaniel&rsquo;s characters had cancer; they wrestled with all kinds of chronic illnesses (cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, diabetes) as well as the untimely death of loved ones from causes including suicide. McDaniel&rsquo;s books were about grief and communities formed through crisis.</p>
<p>These books would have been perfect for a budding hypochondriac, or for a reader inclined toward purple prose and melodrama, but I read them instead for medical details, taking mental notes on how to recognize signs and symptoms and stockpiling already-outdated knowledge about treatment options. Rather than imagining myself as the sick main character, I occupied the position of the doctor, a role I planned (at the time) to take on later in real life. It turned out, though, that I would have to be the protagonist anyway.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer in January 2019. I was thirty-four at the time, with zero family history and no warning signs aside from the lump I hoped fervently would be a cyst. Immediately, I was launched into a world at once familiar and alien. I had grown up among doctors and research scientists in the orbit of Washington University School of Medicine, largely because my father is a medical ethicist with an abiding interest in the practical applications of his work. I had even worked in a research laboratory there from ages sixteen to twenty, studying&mdash;of all things&mdash;the genetics of breast cancer.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    …my best chance at coping with cancer was to make sure I was a research subject, to transform my body as rapidly as possible into the right kind of data.
</blockquote>
<p>Is it any wonder, then, that I investigated my treatment options as though I were the PI on an exploratory grant rather than a cancer patient? The type of breast cancer I have (triple negative) is particularly rare and intractable. At the time of my diagnosis it had already progressed to its most advanced stage with metastases to lungs, liver, and bones. It was immediately clear that finding promising clinical trials would be my best option. My parents and I (all academics) and circle of friends (ditto) kicked into research mode, scouring databases and firing off emails to friends from conferences, people from our past, even casual acquaintances who might have a line on newer, more successful treatments. The numbers were not good. We wanted some better numbers.</p>
<p>As I made phone calls to oncologists and combed through the clinical trials database, I performed a distancing maneuver that I first began practicing when reading Lurlene McDaniel; I became a clinical observer of a diseased body, only this time it was my own. I mentally dissected it, narrowing it down to the cancerous focal points that became all that mattered. I lay repeatedly in CT and MRI machines and held my breath through biopsies with only local anesthetics, willing myself out of the body I was at the same time trying so hard to save.</p>
<p>I became at once both object and analyst, alienating my self (with her feelings about her body and her illness) from my body as a source of information about potential causes and, hopefully, potential cures. In some ways it was the extreme of Cartesian dualism—I would think as the large magnets in the MRI machine echoed all around me—that my consciousness should roam so freely while I tried my hardest not to move a muscle in order to produce as clear an image of my body as possible. I was the mind-body problem made flesh, and then abstracted from flesh into numbers that could be either parsed by a machine or interpreted by a human.</p>
<p>Where did this data sit on the spectrum of mental and physical properties? My cancer was physical but, like an electron or snippet of DNA, it was not directly observable without the aid of technologies nor communicable without the intervention of an interpreter. In each of the two trials in which I&rsquo;ve been a subject I have contributed both pieces of my body&mdash;samples of tissue to be used at the discretion of researchers&mdash;and data generated from it. Because I am a participant in clinical trials, the status of my embodied data possesses an enduring significance, since it has the potential to influence the funding and availability of future cancer therapies, even the lifespan of future patients.</p>
<p>We all agreed that my best chance at coping with cancer was to make sure I was a research subject, to transform my body as rapidly as possible into the right kind of data: not a mortality statistic but an experimental resource.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cancer is invisible and so are data.</p>
<p>Neither exists in the sense of being detectable, nameable, or identifiable until plucked from their surroundings and marked out with a significance determined by the observer. The observer marks a data point as distinctive, distinguishing the &ldquo;that&rdquo; from the &ldquo;not-that&rdquo; of everything around it. Even if a data point is meant to be representative, to stand in for a larger phenomenon, the act of selecting it renders the data point distinctive. The data you select&mdash;and the data you don&rsquo;t&mdash;say something about you as well as about them. Data are not objective phenomena. It is for this reason that digital humanities scholar Johanna Drucker has suggested that it is perhaps more accurate to think of data as <em>capta</em> to indicate their situatedness&mdash;that they are seized and, from the moment of demarcation, imbued with an interpretive viewpoint.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The introduction of the interpretive viewpoint in medicine is called diagnosis. During the initial diagnostic phase, as I received phone call after phone call with more bad news, I spent some time thinking about how &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; sounded like a term familiar to me from my PhD in Renaissance literature, one that showed up mostly in discussions of tragedies: anagnorisis, meaning &ldquo;recognition,&rdquo; referring to the moment of a critical discovery about a character&rsquo;s own circumstances.</p>

<blockquote class="pull right">
    Any promise of transparency or intelligibility must be counterbalanced by the knowledge that all data have a viewpoint because they have an observer.
</blockquote>
<p>You will not recognize that you have cancer until someone tells you. You may have a suspicion that something is not quite right, but you require professional assessment. Assessment comes in the form of quantification, which requires abstraction. Your physical body is transformed into radiological images by technologies that allow trained specialists to measure and quantify, to compare averages and standard variations, and to relay that information back to you in language that leads, invariably, to another set of numbers concerned with averages and likelihoods. Where is the line between &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;pathological&rdquo;? In whose view is a treatment &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo;? When the questions are of life and death, it is more than a little disconcerting to realize that the answer depends very much on who you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>Cancer exists before it is named, just like data. And even at its moment of detection (capture) its fixity is illusory: it is in cancer&rsquo;s nature to grow and change, just like data. The moment of visibility for both is firmly situated in time, place, and the subject position of the interpreter. Take, for example, the open question of how extensively cancer may have spread to my liver. Unusually for my age, I was actually tested for cancer in 2016, in search of answers to a years-long chronic fatigue for which I still have no good explanation. The bone marrow biopsy showed no cause for concern and even though there was a lesion on my liver, measuring 29 mm x 28 mm, the conclusion was that it was a benign growth called a hemangioma. (I stand by this view, if only because a cancerous growth on my liver, a canary in a coal mine, would have become significantly worse over the course of three years given how aggressive cancer has been elsewhere in my body in the time since my diagnosis.)</p>
<p>My first CT after diagnosis in January 2019 showed the liver lesion to be 29 mm x 35 mm, a finding that the radiologist remarked might represent growth (and therefore metastasis) or might not, since a difference of 6 mm could be caused by different positioning during the scan or different measurements by different doctors. The lesion continued to remain stable on my next CTs, but in March 2019 an additional spot was detected on the right inferior lobe, measuring 12 mm. By June 2019 that spot was reported to be 28 mm, confirming that my liver had been affected. In December the second lesion was measured under 5 mm, part of a larger pattern of regression that meant the treatment was working (which it had been doing but would not continue to do past that month). A third spot on the left lobe was recorded in three scans, showing up as 5 mm August 2019, 4 mm in September, and 3 mm in November. By December that third spot went unremarked. The large lesion from 2016, however, merely waxed and waned, never clocking in at more than 35 mm or fewer than 27 mm, numbers easily attributable to variation in imaging or interpretation.</p>
<p>So was the original liver lesion a benign hemangioma, a coincidence unrelated to the cancer that would metastasize years later, or the first sign that a breast cancer concealed in single, unmassed (and therefore undetectable) cells had already done so? Did the 2016 scan produce bad data, or rather bad capta? Was the interpretation of the image biased by the fact that I was young (thirty-one) and, aside from mysterious, debilitating fatigue, healthy? Should I have acted differently? Should my doctors? The ramifications of these questions for my diagnosis and emotional response to it are profound: a cancer that had been present since 2016 would look relatively less aggressive compared to one that was new as of 2019; being misdiagnosed and living with cancer for three years would compound my fear (and guilt) that my situation was preventable.</p>
<p>There is no way to know, though the probability is strong that the first lesion was and remains benign. But that uncertainty is the constant condition of the body as data. Any promise of transparency or intelligibility must be counterbalanced by the knowledge that all data have a viewpoint because they have an observer.</p>
<hr>
<p>In <em>The Undying</em>, her account of treatment for triple-negative breast cancer, the poet Anne Boyer writes that &ldquo;a patient is a system-containing object within a series of interlocking systems full of other system-containing objects&rdquo; and that &ldquo;to take a thing or set of things from one system and reclassify these as elements in another also resembles diagnosis, which takes information from our bodies and rearranges what came from inside of us into a system imposed from far away.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Cancer is caused by the body&rsquo;s own cells growing out of control, a hostile takeover from within that violates the rules of the system already in place. Reclassified, your own cells are a disease and your own body a weapon. Reclassified, you are not an individual but a patient and your body not a collection of sensations but a rich mine of information.</p>

<blockquote class="pull left">
    Living your life as medical data is an alienating experience particularly if, like me, you look bad on paper.
</blockquote>
<p>Once you enter the systems of modern medicine you become data to be ingested, part of the larger dataset of those who have previously been ill, been treated, and lived or died. This is not the &ldquo;violence of abstraction&rdquo; of which Marxist theorists wrote, yet the phrase seems equally applicable to the anonymity&mdash;the interchangeability&mdash;of those subsumed by the medical-industrial complex. Part of the reason that I sought clinical trials was that I felt that it was the best way to enable physicians to see me as an individual whose life, and whose treatment, mattered. I was eager to make myself an object of study and contribute to thwarting the disease that is threatening my life. But I was equally eager not to be simply tagged, processed, and swept through the prescribed (and not very promising) series of treatments that constituted the &ldquo;standard of care&rdquo; for my type of cancer.</p>
<p>Living your life as medical data is an alienating experience particularly if, like me, you look bad on paper. Boyer describes herself as &ldquo;a patient made of information, produced by the work of women,&rdquo; remarking on the &ldquo;paradoxical simultaneity&rdquo; of the care work and data work performed by the overwhelmingly female nursing staff in their interactions with patients.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It is crucial to focus on the significance of the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; here. None of us exist as free-floating data points; medical data are <em>made</em>, are in fact <em>capta</em> that depend on nurses and technicians, radiologists and pathologists, and, perhaps most of all, on patients.</p>
<hr>
<p>Cancer is invisible, and so are viruses.</p>
<p>I have worked on this essay over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. I began it in March 2020, days after my workplace went remote and fourteen months after my initial cancer diagnosis. It is now October 2020, my third line of treatment has failed, and I am moving on to another. The pandemic still ravages much of the country. Conceiving of bodies as &ldquo;made of information&rdquo; (and participating in the quantification of illness and the violence of abstraction that accompanies this process) has become a national way of life.</p>
<p>I have lived nearly two years tolerating the same kind of existential uncertainty and fear of an alien invader in the body that the world as a whole is now experiencing. I have played my own doctor, watching my body for signs that a treatment is working, or that it is not, in much the same way we monitor ourselves for symptoms. I have tried to anticipate what will happen if I become severely immunocompromised and have given up many of the pleasures that made my life better before (traveling, going out with friends) in the name of my health. I have offered my body up as data to research scientists with the goal of furthering not just my own treatment but survival prospects for the future.</p>
<p>I did not know that I was in training for a time when we would all of necessity be regarded as bodies with the potential to produce valuable data about the spread and effects of COVID-19. We are constantly starved for numbers, for data on infections and recoveries and for statistical models that may relieve us of the uncertainty we feel about the future. I cannot provide that. But I can tell you to be cautious readers of data and statistics that speak with any pretense to authority right now, even though I crave them too.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of the data. Some of us clamor loudly to be heard, to be seen and counted by institutions that deliberately overlook and under-report. For some of us, visibility entails vulnerability and the threat of unemployment or detainment weighs so heavily that illness must remain invisible, ignored or hidden. We are the data, but we do not always speak for ourselves.</p>
<p>Susan Sontag wrote in <em>Illness as Metaphor</em> that &ldquo;everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> A pandemic transcends borders but does not do away with the kingdom of the sick. As someone already resident, I can say to you: welcome. The hardest thing about being here is the grief for what we have lost, including a sense of normalcy. The best thing, though, is what we may find: community in a time of crisis.</p>

<p>The yarn <em>on which</em> you weave a piece, which acts as the base of the weaving and sits longitudinally is called “warp”; yarns you use to weave a piece are called “weft”.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up-the-warp-on-the-loom">How to set up the warp on the loom</h2>
<p>If you purchase a loom, it will most likely include setup instructions. However, below are a few great resources on how to set up the warp on a rigid heddle loom.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1WrHOTjxY">A video that carefully demonstrates the steps visually and verbally</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wearingwoad.com/saori-weaving-tutorial-warping-a-rigid-heddle-loom/">An article that includes a written description of the steps </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ashford.co.nz/images/download_pdfs/learn_to/learn_to_weave_on_the_rigid_heddle.pdf">A downloadable PDF that includes visual and written instructions </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Approximately 37 inches of warp yarn were cut and set up on the loom to weave pages 15–27, which makes up half of chapter 1 of <em>de la Grammatologie</em>.</p>

<p>Note: If the yarn is thin you can use the shuttle and the upper and lower position of the heddle to weave the plain weave. However, if the yarn is too thick you need to leave the heddle in neutral position and use your hands to weave.</p>

<p>Heddle position: upper and lower</p>
<p>Yarn size: 3/light</p>
<p>#1–5 below correspond to the numbers on the images.</p>
<p>To create a plain weave:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the heddle in the upper position.</li>
<li>Insert the shuttle into the opening (called the shed) between the raised and lowered yarns.</li>
<li>Take the shuttle out the other side.</li>
<li>Press the weft into place using the heddle.</li>
<li>Place the heddle in the lower position. On the second pass back (to start the second row), going left to right, repeat the process above (reflected in #6–8 in the photos).</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic weave continues on in this way over as many warp yarns as you wish.</p>
<p>Note: Starting the weave from left to right going <em>over</em> the first warp yarn is better because it enables weaving in the loose end of the weft yarn easily. Starting by going under the first warp yarn would cause the weave to look not as seamless.</p>

<p>Heddle position: neutral</p>
<p>Yarn size: 6/super bulky</p>
<p>Note: images above were taken on a paper prototype loom; therefore the warp yarns are pulling more than they would on a heddle loom.</p>
<p>#1–3 below correspond to the numbers on the images.</p>
<p>The soumak weave is the process of wrapping the weft yarn around the warp yarn.</p>
<p>To create the soumak pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the end of the weft yarn behind the two warp yarns, with the end coming out to the front on the right-hand side of the two warp yarns.</li>
<li>Pull out the next two warp yarns. While holding the weft yarn bundling in your right hand, pass the weft yarn behind these two warp yarns from right to left.</li>
<li>After pulling the weft yarn right through to form your first slanted stitch, make sure not to pull too tightly as this will distort the warp.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continue until you get to the end of the warp yarns. On the second pass back (to start the second row), going right to left,</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>At the end of the row wrap around the last two warp yarns twice. (Reflected in #6 in the photos)</li>
<li>Pull out the next two warp yarns to the left of the end and holding the yarn bundle in your left hand, pass it behind the two warps from left to right. This will create a stitch that slants in the opposite direction. (Reflected in #7 in the photos)</li>
</ol>
<p>Continue until the first warp yarn is met again.</p>

<p>Heddle position: neutral</p>
<p>Yarn size: 5/bulky</p>
<p>Numbered list below corresponds to the numbers on the images. To create the pile loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weave a row of plain weave in the area that you want your loops, using one or two strands of yarn. Please refer to the <a href="#plain-weave">“Plain Weave”</a> section for instructions. Since this yarn is thinner you can use a yarn needle to pass it through the warp as well.</li>
<li>Take the wooden dowel and pick up your “stitches” by wrapping them around it as shown.</li>
<li>Once the entire plain weave row is on the dowel, pull the dowel down on the warp so that it brings the loops down to the support rows.</li>
<li>Gently remove the dowel so that you leave behind a row of loops.</li>
<li>Weave another plain weave row above your loops, and repeat the steps above, while making sure not to pull the weft too much; otherwise you’ll start to lose the loops you just made. (Reflected in #5-7 in the photos)</li>
</ol>
<p>Continue in this pattern until you have made all the loops you want. Once done, weave a support row of plain weave and smash that support row down into your loops. You want to really smash the loop rows down so that your weave doesn’t loosen once you cut it off the loom.</p>

<p>Heddle position: neutral</p>
<p>Yarn size: 6/super bulky</p>
<p>Numbered list below corresponds to the numbers on the images. To create a rya knot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place strands of yarn over the warp yarns.</li>
<li>Bring the left side of your yarn behind and around two warp yarns.</li>
<li>Bring the right side of your yarn behind and around your other two warp yarns so that the ends meet up in the middle.</li>
<li>Pull the end pieces below the top knot area.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Before pulling ends down and tightening the top knot, make sure to match up both sides of the end pieces and then pull evenly, so that the knot ties with all ends at about the same length. Trimming is usually required for a more uniform fringe, but this helps reduce yarn waste. If starting with the rya knot (bottom up weaving), pull the end pieces below the top knot area. If you are ending with the rya knot (top down weaving) you would pull the end pieces above the top knot area.</p>

More formal than a blog yet more speculative and iterative than a peer-reviewed journal, <em>Startwords</em> is a forum for experimental humanities scholarship. Embedded code, data physicalizations, design, and emerging forms of process documentation are detailed through writing that is essayistic, creative, and research-driven.</p>
<p>Each issue features two or more features that speak to a common theme, feature, or concern. “Snippets” invite readers to engage with the digital evidence underlying those articles. Issues will be released one to three times a year, when we have something to share or say.</p>
<p><em>Startwords</em> (ISSN 2694-2658) is built with the Hugo static site generator using a custom-made theme. In support of open access principles, we publish all articles under a Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0) and the <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords">website code</a> under an Apache 2.0 license.</p>

<p>Each issue of <em>Startwords</em> typically involves four core meetings between the CDH team, Guest Editor, and Contributors.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Meeting 1:</strong> Soliciting Contributors and Defining Roles</p>
<p><em>Editor, Guest Editor, Tech Lead</em></p>
<p>Devoted to discussing the issue theme, potential contributors, scope of work involved, and roles and responsibilities.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Meeting 2:</strong> Workshopping Article Pitches</p>
<p><em>Editor, Guest Editor, Contributors, Tech Lead, CDH Dev &amp; Design Team</em></p>
<p>Devoted to introducing editorial guidelines and workshopping ideas for articles and snippets. Meeting 2 will be the first time the Guest Editor introduces the Contributors to the full CDH team. Contributors will be provided with an introduction to the journal in advance of this meeting, and should come prepared to deliver a 5-10 minute pitch on their in-progress idea. The Editor will moderate this conversation, and the Guest Editor will frame the pitches within their overall vision for the issue. If possible, contributors should circulate materials in advance so that everyone can prepare their feedback and ideas before the meeting. In this meeting, the CDH team will provide conceptual feedback (how to frame the argument, what context readers will need, etc.) as well as scoping feedback on how much development and design work they will be able to devote to an article or snippet.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Meeting 3:</strong> Platform Workshop</p>
<p><em>Contributors, CDH Dev &amp; Design Team</em></p>
<p>Devoted to a technical introduction of <em>Startwords</em>, GitHub, and our editing and publishing workflow.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Meeting 4:</strong> Final Review</p>
<p><em>Editor, Guest Editor, Tech Lead</em></p>
<p>Devoted to a final editorial conversation and review of copyedits.</p>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<h3 id="guest-editor">Guest Editor</h3>
<p>The Guest Editor serves as the primary point of contact with all issue contributors. Responsibilities include helping to schedule meetings between CDH team and Contributors, and maintaining a spreadsheet containing every Contributor&rsquo;s name, email address, Twitter account, and title of the feature/snippet they&rsquo;re working on. The Guest Editor will be added to the CDH Slack as a single-channel guest.</p>
<p><strong>During Meeting 2 Workshop:</strong> Guest Editor is responsible for soliciting supporting material or a brief pitch from each issue Contributor in advance of the Meeting 2 Workshop, so that the CDH team can review these materials in advance. This meeting is an opportunity for the Guest Editor to frame the features and snippets within their overall vision for the issue. This will give Contributors a shared framework to work within as they’re writing their pieces.</p>
<p><strong>On Rejections:</strong> “Revise and resubmit” in the context of <em>Startwords</em> means design suggestions and developmental editing. It involves a fair amount of back-and-forth between Contributors, Guest Editor, and CDH team. So, we will consider whether there is enough time within the issue&rsquo;s deadlines to work with an author to develop their piece. Though Guest Editors will solicit features and snippets, it is ultimately up to the CDH team whether a pitch or an article draft will ultimately be accepted. Before rejecting a piece, however, the <em>Startwords</em> Editor will confer with the Guest Editor about the decision to make sure there aren&rsquo;t any other paths forward.</p>
<p><strong>First-Round Editing:</strong> The Guest Editor is responsible for a first-round edit of features and snippets before sending them to the Editor. First-round editing consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that there are no glaring issues with comprehensibility, style, argumentation, and overall fit between the issue’s pieces. The pieces should feel in conversation with one another.</li>
<li>Suggesting which sentences or phrases would be best to feature as pull quotes in an article.</li>
<li>Considering how the article’s opening sentence will be featured on the homepage: does it work well as an opening hook? Can there be any edits that will make the line a) be intelligible to a general audience, b) introduce the article and/or issue topic, c) make the reader want to open the article and read more?</li>
<li>Guest Editor is welcome to edit more extensively or in other ways, if need be, so long as those edits and their approval by contributors still fits within the issue’s production timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="issue-introduction">Issue Introduction</h4>
<p>Finally, the Guest Editor writes a brief introduction to the issue, which will be included on the main issue page. Introductions should be very brief 400–800 words and simply lay out the theme that is bringing together all of these pieces in conversation.</p>
<h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>
<p>The <em>Startwords</em> Editor will conduct second-round editing, which consists of a more comprehensive developmental edit that focuses on elements like style, opening hook, and questions of audience. If the author hasn’t used section breaks or suggested pull quotes, the Editor will consider where they might work well.</p>
<p>The Editor moderates the group meetings listed above, and is responsible for monitoring the issue production schedule. The Editor serves as the point person responsible for facilitating between parties responsible for writing, editing, development, and design. When first drafts have been received, the Editor will send an early version of the articles typeset on a development branch of the site. The Editor will also moderate between Copyeditor and Contributors.</p>
<h3 id="technical-lead">Technical Lead</h3>
<p>The Technical Lead is responsible for coordinating the tasks and time of CDH developers and designers working on a <em>Startwords</em> issue. The Technical Lead advises all parties on technical constraints and implementation, and consults on embedding interactive elements or dynamic content.</p>
<p>The Technical Lead oversees CDH developers and designers who will be responsible for converting finished features and snippets from Google / Word Doc into markdown, generating PDFs and depositing them in Zenodo, adding DOI to article metadata, and ensuring images are formatted properly with the appropriate alternative text. More details are available in the Asana “issue release checklist” template.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><title type="html">Style Guide</title><link href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/guides/style-guide/?utm_source=atom_feed" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/><id>https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/guides/style-guide/</id><published>0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-02T15:35:01-04:00</updated><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview-of-the-journal">Overview of the Journal</h2>

<p><strong><em>Startwords</em> publishes experimental humanities research for a public audience.</strong></p>
<p>Things we look for in the articles we publish:</p>
<ul>
<li>story just as important as argument</li>
<li>academic writing that allows for interpretive flexibility and exploration on the part of readers</li>
<li>portrait of a project in progress</li>
<li>interactive features</li>
<li>digital methods in fields that don&rsquo;t traditionally have them applied</li>
<li>writing that is engaging for a public audience</li>
<li>writing that shows people how we understand, read, and use data in the humanities</li>
</ul>
<p>For style inspiration, contributors can review other publications like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/">Triple Canopy</a> • <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a> • <a href="https://distill.pub/">Distill</a> • <a href="https://jsdp.enslaved.org/">Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation</a> • <a href="https://parametric.press/issue-02/">Parametric Press</a> • <a href="https://emergencemagazine.org/">Emergence Magazine</a></p>
<p>Each issue of <em>Startwords</em> showcases (typically) two feature articles (2,000–5,000 words) in conversation on a shared theme. That theme is encapsulated by a keyword for the issue’s title (i.e. Issue 1: “Transformations”, Issue 2: “Scribes”).</p>
<p>Snippets, consisting of a couple hundred words of context and an interactive feature, elaborate on the issue theme with short provocations, tutorials, code, annotated data, or other nontraditional scholarly output. Snippets can be related to one of the two features (i.e. instructions for reproducing the feature article’s results), or snippets can be devoted to an entirely separate project, so long as they relate to the issue theme.</p>
<p>If using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word to write your articles, please keep in mind the following features of how <em>Startwords</em> will typeset your article:</p>
<ul>
<li>The opening lines of your essay (the &ldquo;lede&rdquo; or &ldquo;hook&rdquo;) will go on the homepage. There is room for roughly 185 total characters in that opening page lede, and it should be a complete sentence.</li>
<li>Authors have the option of creating section breaks in their article with a flourished section break: the <em>Startwords</em> icon.</li>
<li>Footnotes will be typeset using a new feature we call contextual notes: inline annotations anchored to the relevant position in the body text. These contextual notes can contain scrollable media, including long text and images. When linking to an external site or resource in your article, you’ll want to decide whether to use either a hyperlink or a contextual note, but not both. It&rsquo;s redundant to have a hyperlink at the end of a sentence alongside a contextual note. (In addition to making the clicking functionality difficult.)</li>
<li>Pull quotes: you may suggest which of your article’s lines you’d like to feature in bigger text offset from the main body of the article. Alternatively, the Guest Editor and <em>Startwords</em> Editor can select these pull quotes for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="editing--typesetting">Editing &amp; Typesetting</h2>
<p>Rather than having contributors and editors work in a de-contextualized WYSIWYG word processor all the way up to the point of final page proofs, <em>Startwords</em> aspires to an iterative workflow that incorporates writing, editing, design, and development. After receiving your first drafts, the CDH team will create a “stub” or placeholder version of the new issue on a development branch. We will then send you initial page proofs, at an unlisted URL, showing how your writing will look once it&rsquo;s typeset on the site. During the editorial review and feedback process, you can iteratively edit based on how your writing will look when typeset alongside its interactive features or multimedia elements.</p>
<p>If you would like more information on the way we build the journal using the Hugo static site generator and typeset articles in HTML, PDF, and plain text, see the <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/blob/main/themes/startwords/README.md"><em>Startwords</em> theme README</a>.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>Articles will be uploaded to the data repository <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>, which will assign each article a DOI. Articles will be published open access, with CC-BY license, so they can be republished and reused in any other forum or format.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>All images that are informative (not decorative) must provide text content that can be accessed by non-sighted users. Contributors are responsible for writing this alternative image text.</p>
<h4 id="alternative-text">Alternative Text</h4>
<p>For images that don’t convey a large amount of information (for example, photographs) the author should supply alternative text that describes the image in an unbiased way using 100 <strong>characters</strong> or less, since some screen readers will only read the first 100 characters of the text.</p>
<p>One way to think of alternative text is as standing in for the image itself - therefore, the text should never duplicate information that is already elsewhere on the page (e.g. if the image has a caption). Put another way, it’s how you would describe a picture if you were talking to someone on the phone – just enough information for them to visualize it in words.</p>
<p>It should also never include the words “image”, “graphic”, etc. since the screen reader will often say this word before reading the description, causing the user to hear it twice.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>For more information on alternative text, see <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#alt">the WHATWG HTML specification</a>.</p>
<h4 id="long-descriptions">Long Descriptions</h4>
<p>Images that convey a substantial amount of information to the viewer, like charts and graphs, often require a longer description <strong>in addition to</strong> their alternative text (see above) in order to make all of the information available to non-sighted users. In this case, assistive technology will generally first read the alternative text, pause for a moment, then continue by reading the longer description.</p>
<p>For these images, the author should also supply a long description that captures all of the major insights of the image in an unbiased way using 100 <strong>words</strong> or less. There is no hard length requirement, but most assistive tech users prefer more concise descriptions where possible. The long description should try to avoid duplicating information available elsewhere on the page, including in the image’s alternative text and caption.</p>
<p>Long descriptions can also describe in detail particular data points or illustration techniques used in the image, in order to give the user a fuller understanding of the image that approximates the affordances of color, size, shape, etc.</p>
<h5 id="example-1">Example</h5>






















<figure ><img loading="lazy" alt="two-dimensional stacked bar chart" src="/images/2d-stacked-bar.svg" role="img">
</figure>
<p>A long description for this image might read: “This chart compares the proportion of events for new members against the proportion of events for returning members for each year that the Shakespeare and Company bookstore was open. The overall number of events that brought people to the bookstore increases gradually from 1919 to 1929, drops off slightly, then increases dramatically from 1932 to 1939. The chart also distinguishes borrowing of books from subscriptions to the library. During the period from 1932 to 1939, the share of book borrowing by new members increased relative to existing members each year.”</p>

<h2 id="including-custom-javascriptcss">Including Custom JavaScript/CSS</h2>
<p><em>Startwords</em> supports article-specific styles or functionality. For those Contributors planning to incorporate interactive content (JavaScript, etc.), we ask that you develop these resources on your own for now, and then we will integrate into our Hugo build. The Contributor will also be responsible for creating a static version of that interactive content for PDF (i.e. a screenshot of a GIF or a filterable data table).</p>
<p>To include custom CSS or JavaScript in an article, simply include the files in the resource bundle for the article (i.e., within the directory). Any files that end in .css or .js will be automatically inserted via stylesheet or script tag respectively. No preprocessing is applied to these files.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/1/weaving-as-interface/">“Weaving as Interface,”</a> in Issue 1, includes JavaScript and CSS <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/tree/main/content/issues/1/weaving-interface">in the directory</a> with the article.</p>
<h2 id="alternate-versions-of-content">Alternate Versions of Content</h2>
<h3 id="figures">Figures</h3>
<p>Images in article text should be added with the Startwords customized version of Hugo’s figure shortcode. This shortcode will generate derivative image sizes as needed for display, and provides support for extended descriptions for screen readers. See <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/tree/main/themes/startwords#figure">figure shortcode documentation</a> for specifics.</p>
<p>Shortcodes are not included in the text version of an article; figure information should be duplicated in a text version of the figure, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/tree/main/themes/startwords#article-text-version">theme documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-content">Interactive Content</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/tree/main/themes/startwords#deepzoom">deepzoom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/startwords/tree/main/themes/startwords#sketchfab">sketchfab</a> shortcodes both include the optional parameters pdf-img and pdf-alt to specify a static image and image alt text to be displayed in the PDF.</p>
<p>In both cases, this generates a figure that is hidden in the HTML view but rendered in the PDF, with this structure:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;figure class=&#34;preview&#34;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;images/modeling-3d-alt.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;3D printed object and accompanying 3D printed labels displayed on a table; this side view shows labels for the years 1919–1942.&#34;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The online version of this essay includes an interactive 3D viewer displaying a model of this object.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;

The references have been cataloged and categorized by the research team of <a href="https://derridas-margins.princeton.edu/">Derrida’s Margins</a>. Each type of reference (epigraph, citation, quotation, footnote) is represented by a distinct yarn and weaving pattern. For more details on the goals and insights of this data physicalization, read <a href="/issues/1/data-beyond-vision/#weaving">Weaving Derrida’s References</a>.</p>
<p>As a way of turning the weaving into an interface, we offer this experiment with an annotated deep-zoom image of the weaving linked to information about the references it represents, allowing you to explore the underlying data through the context of the weaving.</p>

<cite lang="fr">La pensée structuraliste moderne l&rsquo;a clairement établi : le langage est un système de signes, la linguistique est partie intégrante de la science des signes, la <em>sémiotique</em> (ou, dans les termes de Saussure, la <em>sémiologie</em>). La définition médiévale – aliquid stat pro aliquo – que notre époque a ressuscité, s&rsquo;est montrée toujours valable et féconde. C&rsquo;est ainsi que la marque constitutive de tout signe en général, du signe linguistique en particulier, réside dans son caractère double : chaque unité linguistique est bipartite et comporte deux aspects ; l&rsquo;un sensible et l&rsquo;autre intelligible – d&rsquo;une part le signans (le <em>signifiant</em> de Saussure), d&rsquo;autre part le <em>signatum</em> (le signifié). Ces deux éléments constitutifs du signe linguistique (et du signe en général) se supposent et s&rsquo;appellent nécessairement l&rsquo;un l&rsquo;autre. »</cite> (p. 162)

Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert<br/>
<cite lang="fr">« Cette langue faite d&rsquo;images et d&rsquo;hiéroglyphes, dont se sert la Sagesse suprême dans toutes ses révélations à l&rsquo;humanité – qui se retrouve dans le langage tout voisin de la Poésie – et qui, dans notre condition actuelle, ressemble davantage à l&rsquo;expression métaphorique du rêve qu&rsquo;à la prose de la veille, – on peut se demander si cette langue n&rsquo;est pas la véritable langue de la religion supérieure. Si, tandis que nous nous croyons éveillés, nous ne sommes pas plongés dans un sommeil millénaire, ou au moins dans l&rsquo;écho de ses rêves, où nous ne percevons de la langue de Dieu que quelques paroles isolées et obscures, comme un dormeur perçoit les discours de son entourage. »</cite>&#160;<a href="#fnref:31" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
