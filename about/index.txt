 startword, n. (computer science) A string of letters that identifies the beginning of a valid sequence in a specified language. (literature) The first appearance of a genre in print.  Startwords is a research periodical irregularly published by the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. More formal than a blog yet more speculative and process-based than a peer-reviewed journal, Startwords is a forum for experimental humanities scholarship. Embedded code, data physicalizations, and emerging forms of project documentation are explored through writing that is creative, conversational, exploratory, essayistic, data-driven, and academically rigorous.

Each issue features two articles that are unified by a common theme, feature, or concern. Issues will be released one to three times a year, when we have something to share or say. Articles can be contributed by CDH staff, faculty, graduate students, or external collaborators.

First issue to be released March 2020.
