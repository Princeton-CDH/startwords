- multilingual
  - As a reader, when reading the list of issues I want to know which language is included in each issue, so that I can identify issues with content in my language.
  - As a reader, when reading the issue details page I want to know which language(s) each article is available in, so that I can identify translated content and default language is explicit.

  - As a Spanish reader, I want navigation and paratext in my language so that I know how to use the site.
  - As an editor, I want to document issue contributors once for translated issues so that I don't have to duplicate information or risk it getting out of sync.

- author list
  - As a reader, I want to see all the authors who have contributed content to Startwords so I can see the range of contributors and find articles by authors.
  - As a reader, I want an easy way to discover the author list page, so that I can see it exists and access it from any page on the site.

- editorial
  - As an editor, I want to be able to feature more than two articles in an issue, so that I can accommodate more variety of content.
  - As an editor, I want to add content pages to the site so I can publish editorial, contributor guides, and other documentation on the site.
  - As an editor, I want to use interlude styles on any article so that I can highlight content using startwords-specific visuals.

- fixes/styles
  - Add CSS styling for tables
